"I completely believe in leading a simple life with high thinking towards life. It motivates me daily and helps me in starting my day with full enthusiasm. I describe myself as a simple and sober girl who has great aspirations in life. In addition to this, I am also decent and like to be simple always. I am working as a consultant presently and I am very sincere about my work. I do my work with full dedication and devotion. In future I would like to grow in the same field and reach the top position in my field.
Family plays a very vital role in my life and I respect them a lot. My mother is homemaker and father is currently working in Army. I have a brother who is also working with the Indian Army. In my school I was a bright student of my class. After completing my school education I completed B Com and currently I am pursuing MBA from a well known institute. In my free time I like to listen to music and watch movies. Further I also like to travel to new places and discover something new about that place. It helps me in forgetting the problems of life and I completely relax and enjoy.","Every relation demands respect, trust, loyalty, importance and love. A successful marriage also requires these attributes. I want my husband to be well educated so that both of us gel with each other easily and share a good bond. Further, he should pose a decent family background which holds a good reputation in the society. In addition to this, I would prefer a man from South India.
He should be well settled in life as it will be a major concern for not only me but my family too. My parents want my future to be financially secured. Being well settled in life reduces most of the problems which generally the couples face in terms of struggle for the basic necessities. One of the significant characteristic which I want in my life partner is the understanding factor. It is very important for me as this will help us to trust each other. Further, I want him to be a part of each and every moment of my life. If he is just the way I want him to be, then he would seek a lot of respect and love from my side.
