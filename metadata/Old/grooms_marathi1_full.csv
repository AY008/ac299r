"I am a simple person, considerate, understanding, cheerful, ambitious. A software engineer by profession, I work as a Project Manager with TCS. Having completed my BE in Computer Science and Engineering (in 2004), I perceive creating efficient and effective software systems as my Karma. A leader at work, I believe in inspiring people to not only believe in me, but to go beyond me and believe in themselves. A son and elder brother at home, sometimes play a role of a naughty chap, sometimes of a responsible member, and sometimes just a learner. I am fortunate to have some good teachers in my life who help me gain better clarity of life, and the strength where even if life presents a 100 reasons to cry, I can create 1000 reasons to make a difference and eventually smile. I believe each one of us has been bestowed upon by Him with some unique abilities to be utilized to realize a purpose, which HE wants it to be realized through us. My energy levels are at their best when it comes to public speaking for making a positive difference in the audience's lives. With the intent to create a positive difference and evolve the social consciousness, I have written and published a book on self help - ""Life's Calling"", a book with 108 life transforming chapters leading towards a higher dimension of thought and action. Music has an unfathomable power in it, and I love to experience it by listening to tracks which make me feel pure at heart and closer to 'Him'. Though not a master, I do compose some music. I discover my own notations. I am highly passionate about acting and love to act. We are a small family comprising of my mother, father, younger bro, and myself, and we are looking forward to extend it by welcoming, someone who will be the daughter at home, a sister in law to my bro, and the friend of life to me.

Now working in a Mumbai with an IT company. I have worked as a management consultant before joining my MBA. I am a spiritual but not religious individual, looking for a match with same inclination, preferably a doctor or engineer. I am associated with The Art of Living and influenced by Osho, J Krishnmurti and Buddha at a large extent. In terms of religion I am impressed with Jains, Sikh and Buddhism. In fact, I blog too on business, spirituality and economics related topics My hobbies include reading books, blogging and blog related search on net. I have been an above average student during my academic career, mostly among top 5 in schools (but left 1st position always for someone else). Actively participated and won in Intellectual activities such as Debates, extempore, speech and anchored social, intellectual activities in School cum Institute. Played Athletics, and actively participated in NCC (was awarded as the best cadet). I am a born lingayat not a practicing one. So if you are contacting me because I am a lingayat, you may be disappointed. I am not looking for any lingayat match. Reason - Lingayatism was found on the concept of ""no-caste system"", the hypocrisy of Lingayats is - now within 800 yrs of basaveshwara's founding - they have 16-17 different sub-castes. If you are contacting me because I belong to your caste (or a specific caste), I am sorry I dont (I may not). I belong to the Art of Living Community - I believe this more of my religion than any of the other tag I am associated with because of my ancestry. I feel more connected to the Art of Living than the Lingayats.",,"We are more of spiritual family.

"I am proud to be born in the same year when Indian Cricket team first lifted world cup. I am big fan of cricket and also enjoy playing basketball. As I played these sports for most of my school and college days, I realized that these two sports have taught me a lot in terms of surviving in this tough and competitive world. I learned that nothing comes to you without hardworking and started facing challenges in life rather than surrendering against it. Hence I believe that everyone should be attached with at-least one sport, as other than keeping you fit; it helps you to build your personality in terms of team work, commitment, hard work, concentration, decision making etc. Due to the nature of my father?s job (Government officer in Maharashtra State), I had traveled almost all parts of Maharashtra and made many good friends. It made me adaptive and also helped to know &amp; understand various cultures across Maharashtra and other parts of India. I respect all religions/ cultures as I think everyone is unique in their own way. Few things that keep me motivated &relaxed; are playing adventurous sports (like trekking, para sailing, river rafting etc), traveling to different places, watching entertaining movies, reading management books, talking to best friends and occasional cooking. In free time I like to sleep, watch TV (anything other than daily soaps) or go for a shopping. I feel comfortable in jeans and T-shirts and mostly prefer casual attire. Though I am little choosy about my wardrobe collection but still does not hesitate from selecting trendy cloths only after make sure that it looks good on me.","Life is like a roller coaster.
