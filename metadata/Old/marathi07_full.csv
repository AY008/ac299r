"My sister is a person who looks for a practical end result which is tangible and long lasting. High flying, fanciful notions don't interest her.

A marathon runner not a sprinter, she has staying power and the will to see projects through to the end. A settled home and family life is very important to her emotional happiness. She is protective to the point of possessiveness of those close and will defend them vigorously against anyone who threatens them in any way. Nothing pleases her more than a house full of the extended family and close friends, enjoying themselves. Loyalty is a strong factor in her thinking where life partners are concerned. Once established in a long running relationship she is happy for it to continue on an even course. Beauty, elegance and indulgence make her purr with pleasure. An perfectionist about prospective partners, like them to be well turned out. A nature lover, she adore the wide open spaces, she also appreciate the cultural highlights which big cities offer. Places close to normal residence make her feel at ease so she often doesn't have to travel far to relax. At home a mix of elegance and pleasurable comfort is the look she aims for.
