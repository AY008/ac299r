This feeling for you: To-be spouse and her family I value you as a human and respect you as my own family. Please do not count me with religion or caste. Such act disturbs me and trusts me that will be the day we will spoil our own life. No individual man or woman on this earth is perfect including I and you. We (after united and take responsibilities as WIFE and Husband) can become PERFECT with the union of our unique positive energies, ethics and moral values. To know the sweetness of the fruit, at any cost you need to taste it. In the same way, you can only know the person by starting a relationship with him instead of value the religion tag or caste label. I am ready to know you by starting the relationship. Are you open for the same? I have a special respect towards Indian traditional woman. Though, I am modern but traditional values takes precedence than modern values. Marriage and marriage life will not be complete without two parameters which I will discuss with only my to-be spouse and my to-be family members along with my current family members. I follow legitimate values for all the community which develops me as true human. Let?s talk more in our next communication.

"I am a firm believer of God's GRACE in every aspect of our life whether small or big. Almighty takes every decision in one's life and does everything at an appropriate time, though we at times feel that things are not happening according to our choice, wish and liking. But God's decision is just delayed but never denied if HE wants to give us anything it will be given at the right and appropriate time only and we should have firm faith on HIM and stop doing reasoning. We should wait and watch things to happen and just not jump into conclusions irrationally. If we don't get something that we require, it is still good for us only, because whatever happens is only for our betterment. I expect my partner too have firm faith in God's grace in our each and every activity irrespective of results whether it is in our favor or not at this particular moment. He should take firm decisions with positive bent of mind. Should have pleasing personality and never depressing. Preferably non-alcoholic and vegetarian. I am fair, slim, medium height, always keep myself smiling and active, believe in simplicity with modern thinking, wear jeans, kurtis, salwar suits, but does not like wearing saris because in Mumbai crowd and that too while traveling in local trains wearing saris causes discomfort.","My ideal partner should be a firm believer of Almighty and should have faith and feeling that in each and every act of ours, God's grace is always felt - even in every breathe that we take.

Also, he should not have any room for depressing moments in his life and face every task bravely and face everything with challenge by putting in maximum efforts to combat every situation with smile.
