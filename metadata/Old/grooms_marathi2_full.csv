"This is the place where the reader is expecting to know what kind of person am I. However, it will be better to get the information by a person who knows me well. So I asked my nears and dears what to write here and the below is what I got in reply.
-
Hi, this is Neelabh. I am simple, family oriented, fun loving, caring, romantic and educated. I enjoy ever moment of life to fullest and love to make life simpler. I believe in respecting human rather that by their caste or creed or gender. I believe that men and women are the wheels of the vehicle called 'Society'. Both are equally important and without both being equal, you cannot expect the vehicle to function smoothly.
Life is like a sketch board for me, where we draw our imaginations, expectations and experiences. It is we who decide the flow of life, is what I believe firmly. Bing optimistic and confident, I look to grasp 'The Room above First', as there is always space to grow and improve. I accept changes that are for good and that will make me a better human.
-
When it comes to values in life, I like to be a blend of traditional and modern values, picking up 'The Best of Both the Worlds'. It is a wonderful combination when you pick the best experiences and inculcate them in real life. You have the whole world to pick experiences from, either from mistakes or from success of self or others. So why to repeat the mistakes, rather take the smarter path of being a supportive part of world.
-
I believe in equality and so my soul mate can expect me in every time of need and want with her. She will be secure and happy in my company, for sure. And that's a gentleman's promise. Also to mention, I love cooking and experimenting new things, so will be help in her daily kitchen too. Hope this makes her happier and helps to get more time together, helping and understanding each other, constantly, sharing day-to-day experience and thoughts.
-
Related to hobbies and outings, I love to go on long drives and spending time with family members. I love listening to soft, romantic, classical and instrumental music.
-
Education is a key to success in life. A tool helps you to understand and understood by others. I have completed my PGDBA from Welingkar's, Mumbai. I have work experience of about 6 years, and currently working in animation industry in productions. Related to further studies, I am planning to pursue Six Sigma Black Belt (Masters).
-
My Family: My Father is a Journalist in The Hitavada, a leading English daily of Central India. He is a Chemical Engineer by education. My mother is a teacher, from last 30 years. She is the source of primary education and is the binding force of family. My younger brother is studying in first semester of Engineering. He is mature, friendly, loving and caring. We both have the same family and social values, which teach us of equality and respecting humanity.
-
The first in my extended family are my Kaka-Mavshi. They are less like Kaka-Mavshi and more like parents to me. I am from those few, who have the luxury of having the benefits of living in a nuclear as well as joint family. This is not only about benefits, but also about the ethics and values that are inculcated in an individual that contributes towards the society and nation.
-
My Kaka-Mavshi have two children, both girls. We; i.e.; me, my brother and both of my cousin sisters are less like cousins and more like real brothers and sisters. Today I can not imagine life without being together. My other (Mavshi-Kaka) (2), Kaka-Kaku, Aatya-Mama, and Mama and my cousins are also closely knit. My Dada (cousin) and Vahini and their little daughter have a special place in my life. She is the apple of my eye.","I would like my soul mate to be caring and understanding, not only for me but for my family too. She should be willing to be with me in my happy times and I will make sure that she never has any hard time in life. In addition, I will be there to support her parents.
