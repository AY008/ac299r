"Hello! I have completed my Masters in Computer Applications. I am currently working as a Team Lead in the Software division of a reputed MNC. My friends describe me as: lively, friendly, trust worthy, good listener, a little introvert but once I get to know the person well, there would be no dull moment and to add romantic too.
Values: I believe in honesty, sincerity - be it work or personal life, live and let live attitude, respect for elders and lot of love for children, believe in giving and sharing all the beautiful things of life, love to help the needy and always there to help anyone who needs me. Hobbies: I love to read (fiction/non-fiction), cooking (experimenting :P ), travelling, arts and craft, calligraphy and handwriting analysis. Views on marriage: Marriage is about trust, companionship, complimenting each other, balancing highs and lows in life and being there for each other come what may. Marriage accordingly to me is such a pure and ethereal bond that should grow strong with years, its more of a special 'something' that two people share and come to realise a special feeling that the world calls 'love'. And last but not the least, respect for each other and the strength to stand for each other in trying times.
They say marriages are made in heaven and even though the wait is long 'someone somewhere is made for each one of us'. Waiting to find the special someone that God has chosen for me. Lets see if you can find me before I find you. I am looking for a life partner who is understanding, caring, smart, intelligent, at the same time down to earth. (However, cliched all this may sound, its very important)He should have respect for elders and someone I should be able to look up to. Some one who will be more of a friend, with whom I can share and talk anything under the sun. He should be easy going, loves to enjoy life, explore places and different cuisines.","I am looking for a life partner who is understanding, caring, smart, intelligent, at the same time down to earth.
