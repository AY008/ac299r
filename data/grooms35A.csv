"I am a very open, Down To Earth, understanding and adventure loving person. Dynamism is probably what describes me the best, understand new cultures, try new sports, and am constantly looking to reinvent myself. Quality of life for everyone is one single objective which drives me. I believe that Marriage is the union of a man and a woman who make a permanent and exclusive commitment to each other of the type. A successful marriage requires respect between the partners. Every person cherishes the others, each person likes the other, each finds pleasure and comfort in the others company, emotional support of each other, mutually satisfying physical intimacy, expression of appreciation between the partners, the creation of fond memories, a feeling of safety, friendship, and trust an finally a feeling that the spouse is central to his or her world. Apart from all these, i strongly believe that no one is here to make friendship or for time pass.","My ideal partner should be someone who is confident, someone who believes in family values and understands the importance of family.

"I am a thirty four year old fun loving, easy going, and peaceful person. I presently work for a corporate called Aditya Birla Minacs as Manager, Human Resources at Bangalore. Born and raised in an Anglo Indian family hailing from a little town called Podanur, I, like any other person love everything from Anglo Indian cuisine to the fun and frolic that friends and family offer. I have an outgoing personality, never liking to stay holed up at home. May it be as simple as going out for a movie, a vacation or just window shopping, the great outdoors fascinate me. I come with a load of personal interests that I should humbly say, define me. Music holds a powerful influence on me. Having played the lead guitar in bands for the last fifteen years, everything from playing good old country music to rock and roll at Anglo weddings and dances to playing intricate time signatures for Progressive and Technical Metal bands at Bangalore, its been a wonderful journey through the fields of sound. My first love though is books. I am a voracious reader and simply love Literature and Philosophy.  I write poetry, short stories, philosophical dissertations and lyrics. I am no nerd or geek though and don't bug people with my interests unless they want to talk about it.
My third interest is Painting. I dabble in Oils, Water color, Graphite and almost any medium that leaves a mark on paper. I believe art is putting a line around an idea.

"I am working as a lecturer in an Government Inter College ( it is BVM Inter College, Bharawan, District - Hardoi ) near Lucknow. I put up in Lucknow. 

I have done M. A. in English from Allahabad University, M. A. in Ancient History from Kanpur University and then B Ed from Kanpur University. 

Well.... now comes the difficult part of describing about myself :)). Let me give it an honest try. 

I am a level headed, mature and understanding person. 
An avid reader, easygoing and 'fun to be with' sort of person. 

It took a bit longer for my marriage as being a guardian I had some responsibilities. I first wanted to get all of my brothers/sisters settled first. By God's grace everyone is now either well settled or on the way of.

Though did not want to become a Lecturer as a first preference, I can't complain :). Fate always plays its hand well. At the end I am happy with whatever I am.


We are Gautam Rajpoots. Our ancestral origins go back to Argal State in Fatehpur (U.P.).

In my family, I have my mother and we are 7 siblings. 

My father passed away 6 years ago. 

Am eldest of all among us siblings.

Next to me is a sister who is married to a businessman (In Chauhan Rajpoots) in Fatehpur. 

The brother next to that i. e 2nd no brother, is a software engineer and is working in Royal Bank Of Scotland, Gurgaon. He used to work earlier in J P Morgan Chase, Mumbai.

3rd no. brother is M.A. , B. Ed. He is a registered contractor. He stays at home with mom, takes care of our farming and carries out his construction (road, school etc ) contracts. 

4th one is has finished his B. Com. and is now preparing for MBA entrance exams in Delhi. 

The last brother is in final year of B. Tech. (Computer Science) from Jaypee University of Engg. and Tech. Guna, MP. 

Youngest of all is a sister who is studying and preparing for engineering exams.

Overall, a well educated family and I have the honor of playing the role of the angel guardian :)","Looking for an understanding, mature partner. She should either be a working lady or somebody who plans to work after marriage.

The reason why I am looking for a working partner is, though I am earning a fairly decent salary for an individual, it might not be sufficient for a family to be run :)) And I'd be needing my partner's support to plan out things togather.",,25 to 31,05 Oct 1978,,India,Allahabad,Average,Doesn't Matter,,Kshatriya,Kshatriya,,,Very Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Self,MA (Arts),"35 yrs, 5ft 7in,<br />

"I am posting this for my younger brother. As an elder brother, I have observed several qualities in him some of which are mentioned below.

He is a cool tempered, respectful, and thoughtful person well respected amongst his friends, family and peers for his knowledge and acumen. Needless to say, he bears a thinking and well observant head above his shoulders. 

He is personable, mingles well in friends and family and is good to talk to.   

At present, he is working in a leading position with one of the most reputed companies in the world as an IT professional. Slowly, he is breaking into his own venture as well making a very handsome package altogether. 

He is currently based in San Francisco, USA but plans to move back to India within next 3 yrs. 

We belong to a well to do, reputed family living in Faridabad/Delhi area since last so many decades. Ours is a closely knit family with most relatives living in NCR region.

My father has recently retired from his job as a Marketing Manager with National Insurance Company Ltd. and has won several accolades for his outstanding work. He is still maintaining his job responsibilities as an independent. Mother (B.A) is a kind hearted and pleasing personality with progressive thinking. She has steered the family through thick and thin. 
I work as a Project Manager with one of the India's top IT companies. My wife (M.Sc., University topper) has decided to stay home but actively supports and participates in decision makings. Youngest brother has earned a Master degree from a renowned institution in the USA. He is working in NY, USA as an engineer in a well reputed MNC. I am blessed with two adorable and energetic kids making their way through schooling.","After discussing with him, he seeks the following virtues in his life partner: 
She should be educated, well mannered and respectful to ours and her family alike. Someone who is independent in thinking yet practical in approach. If she prefers to work after marriage, our family would support her. 
A well rounded, pleasing person with awareness to her surroundings will be much appreciated.",,,08 Aug 1978,01:05:00,India,Faridabad,Average,,,Agarwal,,,,Whetish Medium ,,Brother,Masters,"35 yrs, 5ft 8in,<br />

"To describe oneself not an easy. Here I would like to give brief introduction about myself. I m Prashant Mehta an IT professional, a gujarati brahmin guy from Mumbai. I have a down to earth personality and believe in simplicity. I am an extrovert person. I believe that Love Begets Love and Courtesy Begets Courtesy. 

Further i believe that it's very difficult to find good relationship, but once developed it should be nurtured constantly. Relationships don't just happen, they take time to build. They are built on kindness, understanding and self-sacrifice, not on jealousy, selfishness and rude behavior. 

Relationships don't come about because people are perfect. They come about because of understanding. There is more gratification in being a caring person than in just being a nice person.","do not believe in the concept of finding an ideal or perfect life partner. Rather it is the understanding of thoughts and ideas that would attract two indviduals initially. Subsequently, the relationship needs to be built on mutual trust, loyalty and love. 

I'm looking for a simple good looking, understanding &amp;  caring life partner who should have down to earth nature and who believes in indian traditions.

"I am sanchayan sen(Rohan is my pet name, Dak naam), born in kolkata and staying here in delhi ever since my graduation days. Mine is a very small family, father passed way in 2008 and staying with mother. I ama loner by heart and i seek pleasures in natural beauty of life. Simple things as gentle smile and caring heart simply bowls me over. I am searching for someone who can be a wonderful friend with me and with whom i can share excellent vibes. I like to travel a lot and would like my partner to join me in the course of rediscovering ourselves. I do not believe in expectations and hence i do not expect anythign but love and respect. I expect my parter to be loving by heart and humble by nature. All i want is a wonderful friend to spend my entire life with.

More than a wife , i am looking for  a companion with whom i can explore life as it is. I love to go out in the evenings and would expect my partner to share my interests with me, and in the same mould i would like to immerse myself in her interests and hobbies.

I would like her to enjoy life in her sphere, would love to share my passion of music , movies and travelling with her. Although i am not too good at domestic chores but i would definitely help her in setting up our abode. I would like to make equal contribution towards her efforts to make our dwelling place a little heaven on earth.
It might sound too fancy but then i always have been aa die hard optimist to the core. When i have spare time with me, i love to write poems and indulge in literary activity. I am fond of animals and though i dont possess any pet of my own, i am open to adopting a pet if my partner so desires.
Ours would be a nuclear family and i would like to take her out in the evening to either socialise or to spend quality time with each other. We all have the dream of finding our ideal match in this world, it might never materialise but that should not stop us from making conscious efforts towards finding a soulmate for ourselves.
This is the essence of my posting my profile here on this forum.","I am an essentially a Hum Tum member and would prefer my partner to believe in the same concept. I need a good friend , a lifelong companion with whom i can indulge in the small beauties of this world.
Since music and travelling are my passion, would really appreciate if my partner can accompany me in these pursuits.

"Success always comes to a person who believes to work with sincerity and honestly. 
My case too is not different from it. Being born and brought up in a middle class family, I respect the traditional ideologies of a customary Indian family.

Mahatma Gandhi has been a great source of inspiration to me, for his beliefs in the philosophy of simple living and high thinking. I am a very down to earth man but at the same time quite progressive in my way of thoughts. I like the idea of a nuclear family, not because it is fast becoming popular in the Indian society but because of the privacy and the personal space it offers; which I believe is a dire need in todaya??s fast paced world. 

Another habit which fascinates me most is meeting people, having discussions and sharing my knowledge and experiences with them. I believe that this trait is good for personal development, and I enjoy doing the same. It is always preferable to make friends having identical thoughts and ideologies. My friends consider me a true companion as I am always with them in their good or bad times.  

Apart from all this I like to play games and watch cricket when I get any leisure time.

I believe that being ambitious is quite imperative for an individual to achieve desired objectives.  My long term objective is to establish myself well in my chosen career path so that I can fulfill the needs of my family efficiently.    
 
God is almighty and everyone including me believes in the existence of the god and his divinity. This makes my belief in the institution of marriage even stronger. For me marriage as an everlasting relationship between two souls, mutual faith and understanding between husband and wife are very essential facets of a successful marriage. That is how I think I can be a good husband to my wife.","Life is full of ups and downs and one should be prepared to handle such ups and down.  My search for a life partner would end at a person who is matured and responsible enough to tackle these ups and downs of life. Understanding my feelings and walking hand-in-hand with each other all through our lives is what should make us true companions of each other. We should be able to complement each other in every aspect of life, be it personal and professional. Sharing of thoughts, ideas, dreams, suggestions and guidance should be a daily practice between us.  That is how I think we can make our relationship stronger and stronger. 

Respect for elders and valuing their participation and involvement is our lives would be some traits that are appreciated and also cherished from a girl who would be an integral part of my family. 

As I mentioned that I idolize Mahatma Gandhi and hence his way of life and merits attach great importance to me. Simplicity and honesty is another name that you can give to my lifestyle and I look up to having same traits in my partner as well. 

Being simple doesna??t mean that I detest the modern way of thoughts and ideas. I am very much a todaya??s man but yes my way of life is not as pompous as most men of today would have it. 

I would like that my partner should be career-minded and also have a growth path thought for herself, as I want her to be progressive and ambitious in life. I deem that being ambitious makes quite an impact on a persona??s mindset and thoughts, which is very important to make your mark on this world.

All through my life I have kept myself away from smoking, drinking and even a non-vegetarian diet. As per my knowledge all these ill habits are harmful to health as well as environment, hence I have never drawn myself to it; and I would appreciate if my future partner can also keep herself away from such prejudicial habits. 

I am sure God would have certainly made someone for me; he just wants me to find her. ",,,11 Aug 1978,05:55:00,India,Gwalior,Average,,,Sonar,,,,Fair ,,Self,Masters,"35 yrs, 5ft 7in,<br />

"Hi, This is Jayant. I hail from a respected, well cultured family background with moderate values. I was born in Solapur, Maharashtra but I have been brought up in many places in South India like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Hubli, and Raichur - Thanks to my father's job in Central Govt! Currently Family is based in Pune and also in my hometown. Traveling through new places since my childhood has always made me look life in a broader spectrum. Though my medium was English throughout my schooling, it gave me ample opportunity and passion of constantly learning new languages. Not to forget I had chance to see new places and make new friends. That's why I feel I can adapt easily in a group of friends with multicultural background. I did my engineering from Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli in Maharashtra. I have done external courses in Finance during my initial part of career and later moved on to become an SAP Financials Manager.

"Hi, Thx for stopping by. well, myself is Rohit Saini. i am 3 yr old guy, born and brought up in amritsar, punjab, and currently working in mumbai.
Professionally i have done a doc in economics and working as an economist here. Personally, wel its difficult to express lucidly but will give it a shot now. I have somewhat modern values, but respect traditions. Strive to stay on the right side of logic and integrity as much as possible. Loves being competitive, though can be unfocused at times too.

With regard to interests I like stuf like cricket, books, and music. Like to watch movies occasionally, listen to all kinds of music but old numbers are more of a favourite. Used to play a lot of cricket, now mostly confined to watching. Like a broad range of literature. while all works of Ayn Rand are my favorates, at times i enjoy thrillers of Sydney Sheldon too. Also like science fiction in most forms and despite academics in economics, physics remain something i love. Like spending time with friends and enjoy life to the fullest when i am free.

Here, i am looking for someone who is good at heart and level headed, a reasonable person with mix values, in short a balanced human being. Rest we can talk when we get in touch.",,,28 to 32,04 Jan 1978,03:43:00,India,Amritsar,Athletic,,3 brothers ,Saini,Saini,,,Wheatish ,,Brother,Ph.D. (Doctorate),"35 yrs, 5ft 9in,<br />

"I said to myself that the lady that I am looking for should have a fair chance to find me first or, otherwise, get to know about me!! 

So... here I am!!!

Ergo, here's who I am!!!!

------

I am a thinking person. I know my mind and am independent; frank; responsible; trusting; trustworthy; and fearless. 
I am firm on my principles, but never harsh in my interactions. I am always up to helping people, but cannot be pushed around. 
I focus my energies on bringing about openness and sincerity in any relationship. I value the genuine empathy, the caring and the sharing that emerge out of such earnestness. 
Traveling is my passion -numero uno. I relish going places; meeting people; and enjoying the sights, sounds, tastes and aromas of different cultures and ways-of-life. 
I take interest in almost all kinds of arts and artistic manifestations - films; paintings; sculptures; dramas; magic; dance forms; literature (both prose and poetry) - and diligently pursue these interests. 
I derive superlative relaxation from listening to music (any time); from singing (often); and from dancing (occasionally). 
I consider myself to be a gourmet and derive as much pleasure from cooking (nothing fancy though - just simple, home-cooked Marathi fare), as I do, from trying out different cuisines or culinary items. 
I am an indefatigable admirer of nature and take special interest in 'People Watching'. I get along well with people and have the tact and humour that make for a good conversation. 
Self-expression and a well-balanced life are the things I am ambitious about and have been in the pursuit of - with reasonable success - which I am determined to keep up. 
As a 'Development Practitioner', my work pertains to 'Public Policy' research and analysis and designing, management and assessment of developmental projects. 
I believe there can be no end to how much and how well one can grow in the right companionship, even as this companionship is mutually cultivated - based on love; meaning; regard; reciprocation; and inspiration.","In her I'll look for: an awareness of her self; the courage of conviction; a multi-faceted persona; and the zeal to admire, share and live-up life in all its colours and shades.

"Few words about my son

Thank you for stopping by and having a look at my profile.

It's always hard to describe yourself, I am a bubbly and a sociable person, good sense of humour, mix with all ages.

Hobbies I enjoy playing snooker and enjoy watching Hindi soaps as and when I get the time.

1. How they look (Appearance)
This is something that does not really matter to me.
Looks are not what matters, it is what is on the inside, how the person have been brought up within their family life.

2. Age difference (the number of years between ages)
To me, age is just a number six to eight years is the most comfortable for me, but I will consider anyone I feel I have a real connection with.

3. Religion denomination
This is NOT very important to me. I am not going to turn down someone just because they don't attend a mandir, but she has to be strong in her faith.
Don't get me wrong I believe in god and when I get the time I attend the Temple Religion is not forced onto anyone it's our faith and how we believe in it.

4. Financial security (Rich, poor)
Honestly I don't care. I have always wanted to start with absolutely nothing so we knew we love
Each other for us, not for what we have Money shouldn't dictate the two peoples life, as you are marrying someone for who they are and not their wealth

5. Education level (High school, College, etc)
My bride would have to be able to discuss odd topics on at least an intelligent level I would say this requirement would lead to at least High school.

6. Attitudes towards life (Views on politics, issues, family)
I am not much on politics so that doesn't really make much of a difference to me. As long as her moral views are similar to mine. Of course I wanted somebody who wants a family, but I didn't have an ideal number of kids I was shooting for.

It's a dream that needs to be fulfilled together

There's more to me but as stated earlier it's difficult to describe yourself to find out more email me and please provide your contact details so I can contact you.

"I believe life is full of adventure, trill, fun, problems &amp; contradictions but you have to maintain a balance. You can not get everything right but you can assess &amp; search anything right from a wrong. No tensions just think; do it or leave it. You must be clear in your thought and everything can be contradicted or can be solved. Full happiness but a bit seriousness. There must be a bundle of hobbies and no boredom but no habit. There is no need to change life but you can change you. It is a matter of approach. Sometimes a negative approach will work. You must say 'LET IT BE'. Excess of everything is bad. But there bust be perfection in everything you do. Besides this, I enjoy going for long walks, journeys, and traveling, adventurous things or just like to try out, when i find something exciting. I tried skeying, balooning, paraglyding, river-rafting etc. I visited many places specially Jabalpur, Amarnath, Kedarnath, neelkanth etc. many times. My date of birth is 15.11.77. Place:Panipat at 11:40 P.M.","I wish to spend my life with someone who is considerate, loving, communicative, frank with me at least, with whom I can share everything, with whom there is no need to tell a lie, romantic and fun to be with... yes, someone very special....... Whatever the circumstances a smile on whose face would mean a lot to me and vice versa :) .....this may sound like over-high expectations, but I feel that these qualities, together with mutual love, respect, commitment, honesty understanding and trust are important for an interesting &amp;   happy marriage. Needless to say, honesty is a sine qua non of it! She will get the same response with me also. She must have a bit humour with a sought of forgiveness and forgetness of the silly things in life. She has to just look at me in the tense surroundings. Till we are right, no situation can make us puzzle. It is equally important to take it in a spirit of practicality, which doesn?t make us neglect our responsibilities and aims!!
I am looking for a normal person who is intelligent, stable and would like to embark with me on this journey called life.

"Our son aged IS 35 years is a BBM graduate. He worked in BESCOM, FEDEX, AVC Infotech and SLK software at junior level. He got first class in 10th standard and was above average. Mild Schizophrenia struck him at the age of 18. Early diagnosis and medication ensured debility well under control. His elder brother is happily married and settled in Canada with his wife and a son. We are in a dilemma whether our son should marry at all. Unable to decide between the parental obligations and the guilt of cheating a girl who would be his wife, we pondered over the issue for 7-8 years. Some of our friends and relatives advised he be married as the debility is not serious in nature. After giving a considered thought, we are now looking for a suitable bride for him. Our son often expresses his desire to marry but we are holding him up. He is honest, innocent, law abiding and a gentleman who would not harm others. He does not smoke and is a teetotaler. He left the job in August 2011. He is uncomfortable working in the company of others.  He has inferiority complex and is self conscious. He drives 2 wheelers, cars, does all his personal works including banking. He maintains good physical health, sees TV programs, is fond of English songs and movies. About ourselves: I am 66 years old and retired and my wife 56 years. We are in good health and have no health problems. Expectations from our would be daughter in-law: Our would be daughter in-law should not a divorcee and can be a widow without children. She could be of 30-40 years, be a Kannadiga. She should be educated, gentle, caring and understanding. She should be able to put up with a gentle and a non violent patient. She could be non vegetarian but not beef or pork eating one. Caste no bar. Future of their married life: If everything goes well, it could be a happily married life. We will ensure them a comfortable life but definitely not a luxurious one.

"Hi.. ! Thanks for browsing my profile. !

 Basically I think that writing all the blah blah here does not make sense till you actually interact or communicate with the person. But to let things roll.. am mentioning a brief picture about me. 

My name is Hrishikesh. I am a grad in Chemical Engg and a post grad in textile design from NIFT Delhi. Currently have just started to pursue my PhD in design from CEPT university. I am an entrpreneur by nature and am putting my efforts to establish an identity for my recently started design studio. 

The rest like hobbies, nature, etc are all very simple and basic that make a human being. I like to be a warm and casual person, enjoy being friends, having a good time with my family. embarking on trips. Moivies, photography and other fields related to design is my passion. In fact I enjoy them more as a sense of activity for engrossment than a moneymaking venture. I am a visual thinker and the, how, what, who, which, when, where, whom aspects of knowledge intrigue me. I do have my ambitions in life but would not loose my calm by being impatient. 

Religion to me is more of a faith in the Almighty and His creations, rather than a dictum to be followed. Though I follow many dictums which have a logic and a deep philosophy to back them. They do have a postive effect on the life that you live. 

About companionshiip in life, well I thiink that its your karma that takes you where you belong. I am a strong believer in exposure and experience in life. Values and perceptions in life are what matter the most. They build up the broad nderstanding. They open up your mind and persona and that helps companions share a mutual relationship, live like buddies in thick and thin making every moment wonderful as time just passes away. , Concern, care, trust, faith and love is how any relationship progresses and every stage triggers a step further experience than the former and surely a better one. 

Phew.. I woudl stll like to reiterate that it would be interesting to interact and find out as the talk progresses rather than develop a judgemental attitude from all this text. After all, we are all looking out for buddies for life.

Another reason why I want to marry a teacher is because they are a little less occupied compared to any other profession. This way she can take care of her career and household together without getting stressed. 
If she feels stressed, I will be there for her. I can help her out with anything thing she wants, it can be her job, family or household. I am not one of those men who feel disgraced like many other Indian men do. 
I am traditional but dona??t mind being modern if it is convenient. I prefer what is practical. Therefore, she can be either be traditional or modern or a combination of both. I mind none and have no reservations about that. 
I am very honest and I would expect the same quality in her. I also want her to respect my family and if she does, she will receive a lot of love from them. All she has to do is be herself as I dona??t appreciate artificiality.

"What do you say on a forum as impersonal as the internet esp. when you are seeking a soul mate ??... Well you put in what you think is your honest picture of yourself and hope (REALLY HARD) that there is someone out there who is looking for someone like you !!!

So here goes, I am a simple but very liberal (in thought and action) muslim who believes that the religion you practise is incidental to your birth. Dont get me wrong, I am a proud muslim but someone who doesnt quite agree with the picture of the religion that is painted by many a zealot across the world and one who openly defies dogma. Whoops this turned out to be quite a controversial start to my personality. 

Anyway, I am a postgraduate who currently works in the FMCG sector and makes enough to ensure that he doesnt have to go hungry and undertake his other passions - Music and Traveling without having to think about what next? I love traveling, food, reading and music, not necessarily in the same order. I have few but very supportive friends who I know I can wake up in the middle of the night without hesitation and a fantastically awesome family that comprises my two younger brothers and my parents. These are people I can kill for and I know they would do the same for me. As for the rest, I have a lot of acquaintances as part of my job, but then who doesnt in today's world !!!

I am looking for a companion, someone who I can hold a conversation with and not someone who necessarily matches with me on a ""list of criteria met"", cause I honestly dont know who that person and what she would be doing? I am looking for someone who likes whats closest to my heart - Music &amp; traveling coz I would like to share these moments with that special someone (else either the girl would get mad at the constant music playing around in the house or will run away with a more stable stay at home typa guy as I am constantly ""planning"", if not actually on a holiday somewhere). All the rest of it would probably be incidental if we can cross these fundamental but monumental hurdles;-)

Anyway wont make this into an autobiography so will let a few things be unsaid so that we have something to talk about incase someone does decide to get in touch !!!

"I'm a resolved and a very patient person. I think, ponder and dream a lot. When it comes to choices and opinions, I'm sure about mine but at the same time I'm open to differences from others. 

Humour is something I enjoy at any given chance. I don't party often, but my idea of having a good time would probably be hanging out with friends at a coffee place, travelling to some nature's paradise or just watching a movie. I love listening to music of any kind, as long as it is melodious and thoughtful or groovy otherwise. 

I'm not very materialistic and I don't prefer to be overtly practical. I love my family and my loved ones, and their happiness is most important to me. I give a lot of importance to virtues like honesty, hard work, compassion and humanity over anything else. 

But of course, I have a few goals to achieve in life. Most importantly having a home of my own, a family and a secure future.","I'm looking for a relatively simple, pretty and mature girl who is understanding and intelligent. Someone who would easily understand me, accept me as I am and help me grow as a person by her mere presence in my life. I would love to spend my life with someone who would share most of my passions, if not all.","My family has been based in Bombay for almost 25 years - since me and my only sibling, my older brother were toddlers.

"The fragrance of rain drenching the parched earth, the flash of lightning against an ink-blue sky, the temple bells chiming on festival day... itA?s these small pleasures in life that make me happy. For me, festivals related to Lord Krishna are very important A he is our family deity after all. But I respect all religions and faiths. When I am passing by a church, gurudwara or masjid, my hands immediately fold into a Namaste as a mark of reverence. For me all religions are the same and lead to almighty. ItA?s just that each one professes it in a different way. My soul mate should respect my sentiments. For a relationship to be successful, it must be based on mutual understanding.

"About me:
I was born in Malaysia, grew up in Singapore and studied in USA and Australia. I have a very strong cosmopolitan and dynamic outlook in life.

My parents are traditionalists and I admire them greatly. Without their guidance and love, I would never have turned out this successful. I strive everyday to be like them.

They set up this account in the hope of finding me my better half, my best friend, my lover, my equal. I expect my future partner to be independent and opiniated. I want her to be creative and have a loud, wonderful laugh. I expect her to be busy with work, be it either in an office or an art gallery. It would be ideal if it is in Singapore.

I read books, listen to music, watch movies and I am into sports. I play football, run, hike and swim on a regular basis. I love the outdoors and I just got my scuba diving license.

I have traveled extensively around South East Asia for work and pleasure. There is still so much out there to be discovered and I would love to have a partner in my future adventures.

My dad describes me as a voracious reader. He is not even close. Kerouac, Ginsberg, Corso, Burroughs, Huxley, Guevara and Baggio are people that I much admire and ethos I follow.

Photography and art captivates me. Especially Pollock, de Kooning and Gorky.

I am a perfectionist and a sensualist. I am determined, imaginative, experimental, loyal to the extreme, devoted, loving (of the deserving) and a workaholic.",,Father is retired journalist/lecturer while Mother is housewife.

"I believe life is full of adventure, trill, fun, problems &amp; contradictions but you have to maintain a balance. You can not get everything right but you can assess &amp; search anything right from a wrong. No tensions just think; do it or leave it. You must be clear in your thought and everything can be contradicted or can be solved. Full happiness but a bit seriousness. There must be a bundle of hobbies and no boredom but no habit. There is no need to change life but you can change you. It is a matter of approach. Sometimes a negative approach will work. You must say 'LET IT BE'. Excess of everything is bad. But there bust be perfection in everything you do. Besides this, I enjoy going for long walks, journeys, and traveling, adventurous things or just like to try out, when i find something exciting. I tried skeying, balooning, paraglyding, river-rafting etc. I visited many places specially Jabalpur, Amarnath, Kedarnath, neelkanth etc. many times. My date of birth is 15.11.77. Place:Panipat at 11:40 P.M.","I wish to spend my life with someone who is considerate, loving, communicative, frank with me at least, with whom I can share everything, with whom there is no need to tell a lie, romantic and fun to be with... yes, someone very special....... Whatever the circumstances a smile on whose face would mean a lot to me and vice versa :) .....this may sound like over-high expectations, but I feel that these qualities, together with mutual love, respect, commitment, honesty understanding and trust are important for an interesting &amp;  happy marriage. Needless to say, honesty is a sine qua non of it! She will get the same response with me also. She must have a bit humour with a sought of forgiveness and forgetness of the silly things in life. She has to just look at me in the tense surroundings. Till we are right, no situation can make us puzzle. It is equally important to take it in a spirit of practicality, which doesn?t make us neglect our responsibilities and aims!!
I am looking for a normal person who is intelligent, stable and would like to embark with me on this journey called life. I preferred a house wife but if she wanted she can work but she should do it for hobby not for money or security. Her first preference should be to enjoy life with me not just work, work &amp;  work.",,22 to 32,15 Nov 1977,23:40:00,India,Panipat,Slim,Doesn't Matter,,Khatri,Khatri,,,Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Self,ML/LLM (Law),"35 yrs, 5ft 8in,<br />

"I am a simple and honest person who is patient in life. My patience helps me in first analyzing the entire scenario and then reacting over it. Further, I am a family oriented person and like to be near my family members.    
In my professional life, I work with full dedication and do a lot of hard work in order to attain the top position in life. Presently I am working as an Assistant Manager in Fire Pro Systems Private Limited. In future I would like to continue my profession in the same field and reach the heights of success. 
My main weakness is that I am very straight forward and prefer to speak my mind freely. I feel proud of my nature as I at least don't talk behind anyone's back and this factor makes me feel proud of myself.
My mother is a homemaker and father is a farmer by profession. I have a sister who is married and well settled in her life and a brother who is working as a Research Analyst in a Government Organization.
After completing my school education I did BE from Adhiyamaan College of Engineering. 
I have very few friends in my life and they are my real support. Further, I like to spend most of my time with them watching movies and travelling to new destinations. I love to listen to some of my favorite tracks and read books.","The girl, with whom I will get married to, should be a simple person with a homely nature. She must be religious and should give respect to the religious values. Further, she must know how to respect the traditional and cultural values. 
My life partner will enjoy the freedom to choose her career. I will have no objections if she wants to work or continue as a home maker. I assure her complete support and love from my side. She should be well qualified and must come from a decent family background.
I am aware of the responsibilities at home as well as outside home. Therefore, I will be always there to help my wife in completing the responsibilities. 
I assure her a happy future if she is like the one I am looking for.

"I am spontaneous guy, If I like something I keep doing it until I get
bored or something more interesting comes along. I don't believe in
allotting time to any interest, you should keep doing it till your heart
is in it.

I am also very extrovert social kind of person. I am always excited to meet new people and attend social gatherings. Being social is a big part of me. I donA?t like to waste my time in front of the idiot box, I would rather go out and meet interesting people or visit new places. Yes, I prefer travel to TV.


I tend to avoid mean, rude and un-courteous people. I hate it when people are rude to waiters/waitresses.

I am attracted to people with class, style and confidence. I am also
attracted towards people who are un-conventional in their thought and
don't go around seeking approval of others.

I am un-comfortable around people who get easily offended. I am really not for the easily offended types.


I keep reinventing myself every so often - Always changing and growing with changing times. That's one reason I am never out of fashion.


In my free time, I listen to music (all sorts - hip hop, rock, pop, hindi,
re-mix, instrumentals.. ), watch movies (strictly under 150 minutes), visit new places or just learn something new. I follow a strict vegetarian diet, am also into AR ( animal rights).

I think of life as an exciting adventure to be enjoyed and not a boring routine to be counted","I love to have fun and like to be around people who are humorous by nature. I also like spontaneous people, someone who is not bogged down by too much of details, someone who just wants to enjoy life.I like someone who is open to new Ideas and who is open to looking life in a new way.","We are a family of 5.

"Sat Sri Akaal,

I am a simple, educated, hard-working, career-oriented person. I have worked in s/w industry for about 8 years and progressed with regular promotions. Last, I worked as Project Leader at a well-known MNC in Bangalore (Emdedded S/W Development).

I have recently got an offer to join a reputed University in Switzerland for a project-based Ph.D. with a respectable salary. 

Ours is a Ramgarhia family, well settled in Mumbai for last 50 years and leading a simple and contended life with Goda??s grace. 

My father is in furniture business (make-on-order) and my mother is a home-maker.

My elder brother (married) is an Orthopedic surgeon and my siste-in-law is a Gynecologist. My younger sister and her husband are both software profesionals.

"My nature represents me as a cheerful person who is simple in life and has a decent way of living life. I am a very understanding sort of a person and do not take things for granted in life. My kind hearted nature helps me in treating everyone equally.  
In my professional life I am very hardworking and presently working with PNB as a Bank Manager. I do my work with full dedication and commitment and never give anyone a chance to take out any problem in my work. In future I want to see myself growing and reaching the top place in life.  
One of my major weaknesses is that I am an emotional person and it is very difficult for me to keep things in my heart for a longer period of time. I have a very loveable and supporting family who always support me in every situation of life and also guides me the correct path that leads to success. 
My family includes my sweet mother who is a housewife. My father is no more with us and I always miss his presence. Further, I have two children, a 3 year old boy and a new born baby girl. For me my children are the greatest achievements of life and I love them the most. 
After my schooling, I completed ICWA from Calcutta. 
Travelling to new places always brings happiness to me and I also like to listen to some great music and watch movies. Further, in my free time I meet my friends and spend time with them.","I want a non working female to enter my life who can easily adjust in my family. She should be well educated and settled in her life. She must know the importance of family in life and respect the elder members of the family. I will also respect her family members and will also take good care of them. 
My life partner should be well educated and must be from a good family. Her family must be known in the society for their good deeds. I want her to be homely so that she can take good care of my kids. Further, she should be a soft natured person as she will have to help me in upbringing the kids.
I hope she understands me and my family needs and I assure her a happy future ahead.

"Leaving oneAA?A?s own country was the toughest thing I ever had to do. The one who leaves his own country feels he is detached from a very big community. I felt the same when I left my country. I felt as if I am being detached from where I belong.
I left my country for a better future but I always missed my country. I always felt I must return but the chords outside India held me very tight to strive and create a successful future for myself. 
My higher education was completed in Canada. Presently, IAA?A?m in Telecommunications Industry designated as a Product Manager. I enjoy my work and wish to be more successful in the same field. 
As a person, I am very hard working and have a positive attitude towards life. I'm a driven individual, with focussed goals in life. I believe life is what we make of it &amp; I look at challenges as opportunity. 

I value finer things in life and try to maintain a balance with work and play. I enjoy working out, outdoors, reading, travelling, learning music in my leisure time.  I have many friends in both India and Canada and maintain a balance of east &amp; west cultures.","As I mentioned above, I live abroad. Therefore, the person interested in me must keep that I mind. She should be willing to live abroad. I do not want her to panic if I ask her to shift there. 
Living in Canada is not very easy so she needs to be very adjusting and must have a good knowledge about English language. If she is flexible enough she will not have any issues adapting.  
I am an open-minded individual &amp;  understand that her needs as an individual should be met. She can have all the freedom she needs and can make as many friends as she wants. I will appreciate this and will think that she is settling down well. 
Other than that, a humble family background &amp;  balanced upbringing is desired. My partnerAA?A?s family  must understand my situation and must trust me with their daughter. I donAA?A?t want them to be worried as this will make me also very uncomfortable. 
I am very practical and can take care of our household and family if needed. This will not be a problem as I am good at it. She will always have my support in everything and can feel free to tell me if she requires any help. I assure her my attention. 
She should be well educated as I appreciate and respect educated people. She will have me as her friend first and then a husband. This way we can become a good couple and she can feel free with me. 
I vision my partner to be truly unique and someone who is goal oriented in life. A few common interests like eating healthy, fitness, music, movies etc would help but not a strict requirement.
With all these qualities, I can give her a wonderful life ahead. ",,24 to 28,30 Jul 1978,,Canada,,Athletic,Athletic,,Kayastha,,Delhi,,Whetish Medium ,Doesn't Matter,Self,BE B.Tech (Engineering),"35 yrs, 5ft 7in,<br />

"A person who has the ability to learn from otherAA?A?s lives and their experiences can live his life in the most wonderful way. He will know how to do things and if he doesnAA?A?t he can just learn it from people. I have a habit of learning and I feel good that I am like this. People also appreciate this in me.
Since the ancient times, people who were better learners were the ones who survived. I am proud of the fact and consider this habit in me as an asset. 
I am a Finance Professional and have been working for quite some time now. People in my office like my work and appreciate me for being good at it. In future, I would like to excel in the same field and I am sure I will be able to do it as I am a good learner. 
My school education was very smooth. I was a very sincere and an attentive student. After schooling I Completed B.Com, M.Com, B.Ed and MA. Currently, I am pursuing my MBA. I was also the topper in Dayal Singh College during my graduation.
My father is a retired Assistant commissioner and my mother is a homemaker. My brother is a CA and his wife is also a homemaker. I love my family and whenever I get some time off from work, I spend it with them. Apart from that, I have few friends but they all are very close to me. 
When I am free, I like to study and read things that are important. But most of all, I like to sleep.","The girl I get married to, can either be a homemaker or can work. I have no reservations about that. This is because I am no one to choose a career for someone and she should be comfortable with whatever she does. Also, I do not judge a person by his profession. All that is important for me is her personality and nature. 
She should be well qualified and educated as I value education a lot. A person who is educated stands differently in the crowd and knows how to be reasonable with things.
When two people get married to each other they not only get to live with each other but also with each otherAA?A?s families.  Therefore, the girl I get married to must be from a good family and must know how to behave and respect her elders and give love to her youngsters. 
I am a very practical person and I can help my wife in keeping the household well. I am not one of those men who feel disgraced in doing so. In fact, I will feel good that I can be of any help to her. I can take care of the family too if she is not around because of some reason. 
She should be very adjustable and should not take much time in adjusting and learning the culture of our house. I am sure if she is adjusting, all my family members will adore her. 
I am sure she will get to live the most wonderful life if she is what I expect her to be.",,22 to 26,11 Jul 1978,,India,Bangalore,Slim,,,Padmasali,Padmasali,,,Wheatish ,,Brother,Other Post Graduation,"35 yrs, 5ft 9in,<br />

She is  married to a Naidu family in Bangalore and her husband is a software consultant..  They have a two year old son.

My son has just returned from the UK after living there for 3 years. He studied for an year and then worked in Leeds, in Yorkshire (UK) for 2 years.  He is currently working as a Strategy Expert with the Tata Group.  Before going to the UK he was a business consultant in India working with the Tata Group. 

We are a close knit family.  We are fairly traditional, but we also have a very liberal attitude towards life.  My son is a person with a modern outlook but at the same time believes in our traditions.  He believes in high values,  not only career-wise, but also family and  spiritual values.","I do see a life partner with whom I share a special bond, a relationship that is based on a deep sense of understanding and equally important, respect.
