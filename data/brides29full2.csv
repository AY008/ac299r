"Personally, I'm a very creative person. I always believe in the quality of work, not the quantity! Though I agree that nobody is a PERFECTIONIST, but, I strongly believe that one can strive towards it with full confidence of achieving it. I like listening to both English and Hindi music, it helps me unwind. I enjoy watching movies, but, only in the multiplex. Like every other girl, i love to indulge myself in shopping! My life's mantra is to enjoy it to the fullest and cherish every day of this precious gift bestowed to us by the Almighty. Being a Leo gal, I hold a classic and Royal taste for things in life. I have a liberal attitude, with a dash of Indian tradition. I'm also a religious person. Though I'm not too fond of cooking, but, my culinary abilities are worth a try! I strongly believe that each and every individual has a different identity and differ in their thinking as well. No two people are alike. So, their personalities also differ in many ways. I am presently working as a teacher in the prestigious Shriram Millenium School. In future, I would appreciate a partner who supports me in whatever I plan (i.e., to work after marriage or not). Now here comes THE MOST IMPORTANT part! PLEASE read it VERY CAREFULLY! I'm looking for a partner who would treat me like a 'Princess' (literally).
He should be mature but, at the same time he must posses a good sense of humor. Jovial, loving, caring, romantic, supportive,fun loving,adventurous, full of life... ""well settled"", and most of all, he should have eyes only for 'me'. Ofcourse (it goes without saying), I too shall offer the same to my partner. Most of all i shall bring along with me loads of love, warmth and respect for him and his family (as my family would obviously be the most important thing for me). Last but not the least, people who believe in DOWRY should strictly Stay Away from ME because I don't support such anti-social practices!","A guy who is smart , intelligent, well- educated, witty and can treat me like a Princess!

First and foremost, compatibility is very important because spending time for the rest of your life with someone is a huge commitment and without compatibility in values, interests and goals, it would be a struggle rather than a partnership. Besides, maturity is also an important factor for being a good partner. I don't want to hang out with someone who is childish and cannot take care of one's self. At my age, it's time to consider a long-term relationship, which requires not only love and affection but also responsibility and care. Moreover, a partner should be open-minded. Being a couple doesn't mean that we have to agree about everything.
