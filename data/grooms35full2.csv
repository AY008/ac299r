"Hi, 

My name is Abhay and have been in Bangalore since 2000. I have 9 years experience in the IT field and work in a reputed MNC. Being in a techno-marketing role, I enjoy travelling around the world and meeting new people. 

I would describe myself as a highly motivated individial, confident and who believes in making things possible. I set goals and look to achieving them. 

I like to work hard, but like to party hard as well. I enjoy good food and am always up for a nice meal with friends or family. I adapt to situations well, so not very choosy about things. I live on my own at present, with parents visiting once in a while. 

I would be looking for someone who is both outgoing and at the same time brings homely values and gets along well with my family. Looking for someone with whom I can share my feelings / dreams and work together towars achieving them. Probably someone who is open-minded and open to change, for example re-location. Will be good to find a working partner (though it's not a must).

"Being self-made is bliss for people. They feel worthy of many things if they have been able to achieve everything on their own. They are never afraid of taking risks and that is the only way how people get successful. The ability to take risks takes people to new heights. 
I am also of the same type and I am very proud of myself for being like this. I feel I have been able to achieve what is considered as the most difficult thing for many people. This feeling in itself makes me very happy and satisfied with my life. 
Professionally, I am the Area Sales Manager and I am satisfied with my work. I dona??t criticize it or curse the people who give me work like many other people do. I always do things happily and that is how I have been able to reach this far. In future, I would like to excel in the same field. 
My school education was very smooth and I was a very sincere student. After schooling, I completed Higher Diploma in Software Engineering from Aptech. After that, I started working. 
My father has retired as an Assistant Operations Manager from Railways and my mother is a homemaker. One of my sisters is married and the other one is pursuing B.Sc (Computers) from GNIIT. I love my family and spending time with them is like a treat for me. 
When I get some time free, I watch movies and listen to music. Apart from that, I like surfing internet and reading about things that are important in daily life.","The girl I get married to should be working in a good company. This is because I like the confidence working people possess and I also want the same attribute in my partner and this way she will also be able to understand the pressure and tension that people who work have to face and can understand my work better.
She should be well qualified and educated. This is not only important for me but for my family also. I am sure she will be able to adjust well with us if she is educated. 
Being loyal is a very important factor in a relationship. I want my partner to be very loyal to me. This way we can form a very strong and a long lasting relationship. 
She should have a very good family background. This is something very important for me as well as my family as they not only have to form a relationship with her but also with her family and for this, it is very important for them to be reputed and recognized in the society. 
She should be respectful towards elders as this way she will be adored by all my family members, which according to me is very important in a family. I am sure we will accept her as she is but she will have to respect every one of us the way we are. 
I assure her that she will feel as the luckiest woman in the world if she is what I want her to be. ",,25 to 30,17 Jul 1978,10:05:00,India,Fatehgarh,Average,Doesn't Matter,,Kayastha,Kayastha,,,Very Fair ,Fair,Son,Other Diploma,"35 yrs, 5ft 10in,<br />

"I'm basically a fun loving and outgoing personality. believe that everyone has the right to live his/her life in own way and so I respect it. So, I expect that the girl who will come in my life should also respect my view on that. As regards to my qualification, I'm MBA In Marketing &amp; HRM and now doing job at Bangalore As a Area Sales Manager in Berger Paints. I'm well settled professionally and planning to settle in Bangalore for couple of years before I think of some other option :)
I am the Elders in family but probably the tallest amongst all. Since from my childhood times, I have always been fascinated by adventures and thrills in life. Honestly speaking, I feel myself lucky to be born in such a family where there is so much freedom and open mindedness that you never feel burdened by the way life goes. I did my B. com from Purvanchal University. For a year or so, I did my first job in Bangalore. I don't mean to settle for lifetime there but of course for at least some good amount of time. I have seen the life here and hence feel the charm of seeing it more.
My younger brothers are of same lines of thought and attitude towards life. In my professional life, I am always been counted as one of best performer and always maintained good human relationships with my surroundings. I would say, in my life I have seen all possible shades of life and I will always cherish them. For me, my wife is not an exception and hence I would always support and appreciated the life that she wanted to live. I think she will be the one with whom we should sail the rest of life like friends who tender each other feeling and trust and always cherish the time we had together. As mentioned earlier, I am the person who would be glad to offer as much respect and value to my in-laws and would expect the same from her as these are the people who has gives us an opportunity to see this world like a great explorer. Finally, you can take me as the person who can extract the best time out of you and like to hear from you at the above-mentioned correspondence.
Expectations from life, live life at the fullest, it will come back to you",I have a very simple line of though for the person who I want in my life. She should be humble and generous enough to pave the married life to new heights of happiness and prosperity. Should be open minded and overall good personality.

"My profile is not meant for those who judge groom by his profession only. Because a big earning doest not make a person perfect husband, but I believe that a perfect partner is that who know to earn as much as happiness for his wife from whatever he earns. So I would request to reader of my profile to know me and my qualities first then take any decision. My Name is Vivek and I am very simple person believe in hard work and doing all things perfectly.
I am a family devoted person so most important I would love to marry a girl who understand family values. I am working in Germany since last 2 years and I am still a pure Indian and strongly believe in Indian culture. That is why I want to settle in India in near future after getting good experience and exposure from abroad. I am not influenced by western culture but yes I learnt lot of good things from people here like...punctuality, honesty, politeness, how to be independent, straight forwardness etc etc. Of course staying away from home made me good cook also. In addition to that I am a sports loving and fitness freak person. In fact sports is one of my favorite hobby. In my free time, either i like to play out door game or spend time in gym. I play many out door games but Tennis, Cricket and Badminton are my most favorite. In additions to that dance(party dance for fun only) and listening music are my other interests.
I hate castism (which is still one of major base of setting marriages in India), dowry system and also relationships made without agreement of parents and couples, specially ignoring girl's choice.I believe that marriage is not only a relationship between husband and wife but it should be a healthy and strong relationship between two families.
I did Masters in Biotechnology which one of the most recent, upcomming and highly applied feild of science, and then I did my doctorate (Ph.D) in Molecular bacateriology (Clinical feild) from PGIMER Chandigarh.
Working as Medical Biotechnologist in one of the prestigious research institute in Germany where i am having good exposure in the feild of genetic engineering and learning new biotechnological techniques . My job is stable in Germany but still I would like to settle in India. I came here for good exposure and expereice, which has boosted my career prospects in India along with my skills.

About my family 
I belong to a very social, open minded, religious and well settled family of engineers, doctors and teachers. We belong to a beautiful semi hilly city Kalka adjacent (15 km) to Chandigarh. My Respected Mother is very caring and very loving. She is retired from teaching profession. My father (Expired) was also a teacher I have Two elder brothers (Engineer, Librarian), who are married and settled. We all are so close to each other that every new person can easily mix with us.My family is everything for me... so I would like that my partner should know to how to care and love elders and their values. She should help me to keep our family happy (both my and her family), same I will give her back because I consider marriage should not be just bonding of two families but it should be addition in your family. And both partner should try to keep both families happy considering it as single family.","Looking for somone Well educated, well cultured and should know family values. A person who knows the value of elders in family and know how to respect elders and care them. I admire good nature and smiling face, not beauty. No one is beautiful or ugly on this earth it depends how we carry ourselves. Looking for a partner who can be good friend of mine also, because I am strongly against demarcation between boy and girl in our society. So being a good friend I would like to be part of her all activities either at home (even cooking), in professional life as well as during extracurricular activities like out door games, dance, movies etc. I believe in love and care. Love is a one of the strong power on this earth by which u can achieve any thing in this world and care is a universal cure for everything. Same I expect from my partner. I want that my partner should able to share every feeling of her to me like a good friend so that same I can give her back.

My prior experience includes working in the print media, television industry and again in the publishing industry. Being creatively inclined I respect creative people and young talents from different walks of life...be it dance or music. I enjoy watching good english movies, preferably stuff with a lot of graphics and animation..also into world cinema.
Apart from being modern, I respect and follow traditional values as bestowed upon me by my parents. I see God more as a friend and the best way to communicate to him is by visiting temples...where I communicate to him in tranquillity. I see life with oodles of creativity and colours of fun, frolic and fantasy.","As I respect different aspects of creativity, my better half need not be creative but should be a connosieur of creativity of any form.

"So a bit about me..... I describe myself as extremely Ambitious; I live life by objectives and pursuant goals;. I strive to strike a chord between professional and personal life. I consider myself a funny and outgoing guy, that's surrounded by good family and friends. With probably no special interests that stand out, I stay active by going to the gym, riding &amp; flyinga? I enjoy hanging out, taking trips and at times the occasional visit to a lounge/bar and dancing. Yet it's not about going out all the time, so spending time at home is also nice.","For me it's mostly about chemistry and being able to gel/connect well with a woman. Hopefully she brings to the table more than just being attractive, beautiful or even a Barbie. Looks can only get you so far in this world. A great income is not a factor for me either, plus that's not what I mainly base a successful relationship on specially the economy nowadays. If you can cook (not bake) that's a plus in my book, as a partner and as an individual. 

Now, the biggest turnoff for me is a woman that smokes, I don't find it attractive nor healthy. Yet plenty of profiles state, ""trying to quit"", but weeks later that hasn't changed. So when will you? I believe in morals and chivalry, therefore I respect my lady and will treat her with lots of affection. Hopefully she doesn't live in her jeans all the time. So if she can leave them home for the right occasion that would be nice. At the end of the day that's my view but everyone's entitled to live life how they choose. Well that's it for now, anything else you're curious about and it's only a message away

"I belong to a respectable and Aristocratic Nambiar family from North Malabar. Presently staying with parents at Manipal. I would like to describe myself as a simple and strait forwarded person from a middleclass family. Father is Ex - Central Government Officer and now working as one of the Top Executives in a Public Limited Company based at Manipal. Mother is a housewife. I have done my B;COM and MBA from India and I was working in several companies including MNC, s for many years. Then I took a break from my job and went to Europe, so that I can take a second MBA from Europe. But after 6 months staying in Europe (Cyprus) I came to know that the government (Immigration Law) of that country doesnAA?A?t provide jobs to Asians. So I came back to India. Now I am trying for a decent job in Middle East. I am looking for a person who is professionally qualified preferably like doctors or engineers who is well settled in USA, Australia, UK, CANNADA or any European Union country. In other words she should be a citizen of that country. I would also request the person who contacts me should upload her recent photo. You can directly contact me through my email id, so that i can also contact you through mail. If you wish you can even call me directly. Good luck for your search.",She should be a simple and adjustable person from a decent family with clean habits.

"Born and brought up in Delhi in a nuclear family, I have grown up with friends from diverse cultural backgrounds each of whom played a positive role in transforming my persona and in making me the person that I am today. I have come to appreciate the fundamental values such as honesty, compassion, integrity, trust and mutual respect which have been the common thread running through all the close bonds that I have shared and which I feel should be the cornerstone of any human relationship. I was always academically inclined and have a creative bent of mind. After completing my post graduation in Economics from India's premier institute, I have been working in the field of analytics and statistical modeling. I have chiefly worked in the domain of Catastrophe Risk Modeling which is a niche area with a focus on natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and hurricanes. I have also briefly worked in the field of marketing analytics. I am a dreamer and believe that we are born to chase our dreams. And I doubt there is anything called an impossible dream.","I am looking for a person who is good looking and a nice human being. (And I believe that all nice human beings are beautiful). I do not have any specific criteria regarding caste and community although I would like the person to share the same value system. Also, I would prefer the person to be educated and creative. ",I am the elder son of my parents. My father retired as ex-Official Additional Secretary in Government of India. My mother is a homemaker. My younger brother is an MCA from Jamia Milia Islamia and has worked with reputed IT companies. We have our own house in Delhi. My brother and myself also co-own a flat in a  mini township built by one of the most reputed builders in Bhiwadi about two hours drive from our Delhi flat.,25 to 32,19 May 1978,23:00:00,India,Delhi,Slim,,1 brother ,Kumbhakar,Kumbhakar,,Delhi University,Wheatish ,,Self,MA (Arts),"35 yrs, 5ft 9in,<br />
