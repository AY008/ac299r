He should be well educated as education is a very important part of life. A person who is educated understands how to take care of the responsibilities not only in home but apart from home. I want him to be very practical towards life and must respect my family. He can pose any profession but should be settled. I want him to understand this fact as it is very important in life. My parents will also seek for a man who is settled in life. I am sure I can adjust with them if they hold those values that I am looking for.

"About Parul (in her words) Hi,
Thanks for your interest in my profile! To begin with, I am a simple, sophisticated, ambitious, independent and a practical girl with high ideals. I have done B.E in Information Technology from Bhopal and currently working in Pune for a software giant.
I am privileged to have been born to a family of highly educated folks. We have an extremely close knit family consisting of mom, dad and my sis. My dad's a Doctor, my mom is an officer in SBI, and my sis is pursuing B.E in IT (placed in TCS already). More about myself...
I am basically an ambivert person who likes to have her own space. I like to keep things short and simple. But yes, i have my other side too which likes fun as well. My idea of fun is being with friends and family, listening to music, reading, cooking, doing anything creative (art runs in my family)..etc. Nature enthralls me...i am a nature lover who takes a snap of anything and everything that appears beautiful to my eyes (beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder you see:))
Apart from this i am very caring and understanding and know my responsibilities well. My family is as important to me as my career and i am confident enough to be able to balance both of them. This covers quite a lot about me...rest of the details in person :)!!","I am looking for someone smart caring, understanding, down to earth and ambitious.
