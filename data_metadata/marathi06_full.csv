It is due to their support that I was able to raise both my children in a manner that I can be happy about. My daughter is now on her feet, she is working with a reputed IT firm. My son is appearing for his board exams. I will be very happy to accept his family (or children), and provide the same level of affection and care that I am looking for. I am a very good cook, I am well-organised, and have a creative instinct. All these qualities have helped me to run my small family happily all these years. I am a God-fearing person, and firmly believe that He guides us at every step. Whatever problems I have faced, I have been given the strength to fight them.

"An open-minded person knows how to take things in a positive way. He takes everything in good humor. They dona??t mind what people say and dona??t take things very seriously even if they are weird. I am one of those people and I know how to get over negative things. I have been the same since childhood. My parents taught me how to be open-minded. This has not only helped me in remaining happy but has also helped me in getting in the good books of many people I like. Being open-minded has always been an advantage for me.
Professionally, I am a Software engineer in an MNC and I love my job a lot. I enjoy every bit of it. In future, I would like to stick to the same field and excel in it. I have always been a very sincere student. After schooling, I did graduation in B Com and post graduation in MCA from Pune.
I am a person who values her family a lot and I also give credit for my success to my family. They are the ones without whom I wouldna??t have been able to reach this far.

I like writing poems and I feel very lucky that I can express my feelings in this form. Apart from that, I like to read books and do photography.","The man I get married to must be well qualified and educated as I value education a lot and feel that it is all because of education that a person knows how to behave properly in front of others. This is why being educated is a priority for me. When two people get married then a relation is formed not only between those two people but also between their families, therefore, I want that the family I get married into should be very good natured. This will not only make me but also my family very happy. He should be very kind at heart and loving, as any girl would like to expect all this in her partner. I will be able to adjust easily if he is like this and if he accepts me with all his love and respect. I believe a lot in showing mutual respect and love for one another. I expect my partner to be very respectful towards me and I will have the same feelings for him as well. He should not only respect me but my profession and my habits too. This way we can become an ideal couple. I am very modern as a person so he can feel at ease with me. This will avoid many problems between us. I am sure if he is also modern then we can become a wonderful couple. He can trust me with the household work but I will need his help at times. I respect the idea of a good friend in a husband. I will love it if he becomes a good friend of mine as I will feel more connected to him this way.","Father-Kokanastha brahmin.age68, retired from statePWD as Secretary to Govt.now practicing actively as consulting Engineer.
