But ask me to stay at home, and I am going to come down with cabin fever. It takes time to gain my confidence, but once it is done, you will find that I am a very caring and understanding person, and a loyal supporter in your life-goals. I have spent a major part of my life in Delhi, and speak good Hindi. I speak with my family in Telugu and use Hindi and English at work and with my Delhi friends. I love Punjabi food and Punjabi music, apart from South-Indian cuisine and Telugu movies. In fact, I love spicy food and any cuisine that is spicy would get my vote. Music makes me happy and I like to sing, although I can't say I get the tunes right. At present, i am in Bangalore, and naturally, I will give a little more preference to matches from Bangalore, although location is not a constraint. For the right partner, I am willing to relocate to any city, whichever country it is in. I come from an educated, simple middle class family, with modern outlook, rational mindset and an inclusive culture. We are against dowry in any form. I do not believe in religion, caste and creed. Intend to continue working even after marriage. I am not much of a dog or cat lover, although I find parrots, fish etc.","Marriage is holding hands and staying together, in good times and bad. It's about sharing your life with someone that you trust, respect and love. There will be good days and bad, but there should be enough love and commitment to ride that bad phase. My ideal partner should be emotionally strong, ambitious, caring and rational. A sense of humor and patience would be a definite plus.

"I am working as a Behavioural Skills and Language Trainer. Setting up a Telugu Training Institute and training Government officials on job orientation are my professional goals. I love children. Working for the betterment of juvenile homes, social welfare hostels and children on the whole is my personal goal. I love arts and crafts. Making flowers, greeting cards, painting are my favourites. I cannot live without reading books. I love people. I will know the people who meet me in my life, and then love them with their good and bad qualities. But I keep facing issues for being very friendly. I love joint family. Whats a family without elders and children. Being with me is very easy, yet very tough. Its because I do not demand materialistic things. Whatever I expect from my life partner is love, compassion, courage, responsibility and the willingness to be a good human being everyday. I have zero tolerance to male ego or feminism. I can live with human beings, not ""MAN"" or ""WOMAN"". Cooking is my passion. I cannot take even small traits of cruelty, negligence, cheating, irresponsibility. For me love needs to be expressed. Trust and respect build relationships for me. Just true love from my life partner, and I can make life heaven.","I am looking for a partner who can understand my nature. I'm cannot be a typical house wife staying at home. I'm also not a career woman. I earn money so that I have it for smooth running of life. Money and looks are not a matter for me which change with times. Character is something that I cannot compromise on. Especially, after marriage, I cannot tolerate if the person is not honest to me. I'm very affectionate, caring. I can make anyone's life heaven. Laziness, cowardliness, opportunism, negligence, sarcasm, dishonesty are some traits that I cannot bear. He should love his parents and family. Should have respect towards elders and everyone. People lacking energy to organize their lives cannot just do anything. Universal and unconditional love are very important. Its not enough for me if my partner just loves me and doesn't care for others. I do care for him and everyone, and expect the same. Above all, its not just my partner who's important, its all the family that's important. Even if one person is not comfortable, the whole family gets disturbed. I am into social activism. Though I'm into training profile right now, after 10 years, I would get into my profession, as an advocate and activist, dealing with human rights, women, child rights and environment cases. They are highly challenging and sometimes very risky. Anyone who has the courage to face any kind of situations in life only can do these. So even the family I'm married into should have these traits to accept. For instance, sometimes, I might get a child victim home and might have to protect for months, then right now I have no issues, but even later, I shouldn't have. I might be anything outside, but at home I'm completely into my family is cooking, cleaning, organizing, celebrating, taking care of the family members, kids, guests, grand parents, everyone and everything. I give my 100% to my family. All I expect is sincere love just towards me as a partner - unconditional, true.","I live with my parents. Grandmother(maternal) lives with us. Sister and brother-in-law live in next street. We all live together. There is never a feeling that its two different families. Our house is always with my friends who keep staying for days at my place. There is never a feeling that its our house. When I keep doing cases, many a times, the victims were also kept for protection for months. My parents and family members also treat everyone equally. Especially my mom is mom for everyone who comes to my place. I keep travelling, stay out for many days, come home at mid nights, but still my home is a warm place when I return.
