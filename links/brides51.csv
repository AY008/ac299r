"I am reasonable, always willing to listen to varying viewpoints, and ready to see the other side of an issue. Even if I strongly disagree with someone, I try to find points of similarity and agreement rather than emphasizing the differences, though cannot digest dishonesty, deceit and lies. I have a strong desire for harmonious and pleasant relationships, and express a spirit of cooperation, compromise and friendship.
