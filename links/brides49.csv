I live with my family... who have inculcated great values in me which I am proud of. My family has always supported my in my endeavours and has always been there for me. 

I give family values high priority in life, something that I will never give up. 

I believe in living life to the fullest and I take life as it comes. My most prized posesssion is my smile... which I dress up with everday... as I believe that a smile is something which costs nothing but pays like anything in life. A simple smile could change the world around you. I'm sure you will agree with me in this matter. 

I am a moderately religious person. Have immense faith in god and believe that marriages are made in heaven and I truly believe that... God has the right person in store for us... whom he brings along when he feels the time is right!!!

Lastly I wouldlike to depict my views regarding marriage you must have heard people saying that we were married because we were in love but according to me it is the other way round... love is a result of good marriage. Of course it requires some ingredients to hold this notion true... these ingredients are whether both partners share the same goal about life whether they could communicate in every manner the fear/hesitance, his/her behaviour in general and also whether you are ready to accept the person she/he is with no wild assumptions, no compromise, and no overlooking or underlooking of facts. I believe in accepting the person as he or she is than force myself to believe that, that person would change afterwards in extremes. If anyone of them is missing then the integrity of marriage is missing. Once these conditions are fulfilled to an acceptable level then marriage is nothing but a pleasureable journey!!!
