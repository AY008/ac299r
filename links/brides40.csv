I am not the most patient of people but I don't fall apart easily. Asymmetry bothers me, I would never paint my fingers and toes with a different colour polish! A person of very few words, why say something in 10 words when you can say it in 5. That sentence is 10 words long! 
You are someone who can make me smile even when you're not with me. I can sit with you for hours and not say a word and still go away feeling like I have had the best conversation of all. You enjoy smaller groups of good friends and intelligent conversations more than the club and bar scene.
