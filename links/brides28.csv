However one minor details needed to mention, which is during her Alimat studying time her parents decided to do her nikah (only, not Vidai means she didn't go to her husband's house after nikah) when she was getting proposal one after another. Due to Lack of communication left no choice but to break the Nikah by Talaq.

So, basically parents did her Nikah & without even going to her husband's house she got her talaq (divorced), I don't know what would be the name, separeted, divorced......?

"Sessions are held Friday night through Sunday afternoon. At each session a lead couple and a United Methodist Clergy Couple make a presentation or informal talk. The purpose of each presentation is to inspire the couples making the Encounter to become aware of their own feelings about various aspects of their marriage.
The second step - expressing these feelings to each other - is achieved through a technique taught during the weekend, called dialogue. All dialogue sessions between couples are always conducted privately, and away from the group. The weekend is orderly, informative and structured to present a new technique of communication to couples in as interesting and understandable fashion as possible.

However, not everybody?s path in life is smooth and it takes a while for a few to find their right match. Well, I am one of them and I am hoping to meet someone who has gone through the same kind of pain. That way, I think our hearts may heal together and we might just be able to appreciate each others presence in our life a little more. I am looking for a life-long commitment to someone who has positive attitude towards life, is committed to personal growth, and is emotionally open and available with high self-esteem, integrity and a sense of maturity and responsibility.
