"Dear All,

My parents have given me the privilege to jot some notes on myself to help you to get some traces of me and not completely me. 

Understanding about someone can never be accomplished fully, so kindly do not try to draw any conclusion about a person out of his/her profile. My ambitions, my memories, my learnings, my interests, my thoughts, my good deeds etc cannot be filled in here. This is just a glimpse for you to know me....

My parents have provoked the traditional practices in me, but have also taught me to accept every good that could value me, so I am not conventional; I believe that all gods are one. But I am too much fond of Lord Muruga.

People find me as a fun lover and everyone loves to chat with me. That's because, I am a good listener and I intend to reciprocate in their own language which usually cherishes them. I always try to explore and create my own lovely world, where I have also learnt to enjoy from my loneliness and I prefer it sometimes. I do have my playful side, where my family members can opt to cherish them (or) to become my teacher. 

I love to chat with my mom. Sometimes, she shares the same cute story again and again, but it still interests me. I always cherish her love and innocence. I love to pull my brothers leg and we have been always very supportive to each other at all circumstances. My father is equally a fun loving person, but yet known for his confidence. 

My interest has always revolved around my family and my career. However, I love to travel & explore the other side of the world, but had very few travels so far. I love to learn new cultures, languages, watch movies (no matter, what language they are), listen to music, reading books, writings, creative and out of the box stuffs etc. I certainly love to have some intelligent conversation with my better half. I love to enjoy each & every moment calmly and cherish it in my own way. I love nature, the god's best gift. I believe that, the journey of life tend to change and bring new interests in us... So, nobody's list can be exhaustive.

I have completed my masters in management of business administration and had a fruitful professional learnings with considerable years of experience in MNC. Have been a top performer in my organisation and had an opportunity to serve in several domains with the top management team. I recently decided to choose for a break to get relieved from tedium and to invest my time to travel around my aspiration. I am keen to attain some heights in my education even after my marriage. There is definitely lots to share about my interests and ambitions in my profession / education.

Nobody is perfect, so I should have my limitations too. When they are pointed out, I always try to analyze it myself to find a justification, then I work on it.

Anything more than this about me will be too much at this moment. So, signing off with my best wishes for you to get your soul mate

In case, if my profile interests you, then we would like to begin initially with exchanging of photographs and horoscope (if not available in the website) and then the families to contact each other to understand the backgrounds and go for the horoscope match. In case of willingness of both the families to move forward, then a formal meeting between the families, where the prospective boy and the girl can communicate with each other to know their compatibility and ultimately allow them to make the final decision. In case, if the groom is located outside india, then would like to entertain a net / voice chat session for an agreed time frame.

Grooms with following stars kindly excuse my profile: Visakam, Uthiram, Poorathadi, Karthigai, Chithirai, Uthiraadam and Punarpoosan.

The photographs uploaded on this site are my recent photographs. 

The contact number listed here belongs to my parents, who will be more willing to support you with all the information about me and my family.... 

Have a cheerful day... Jeevi",31,Pillai,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",,,5ft 7in,chef1367900,Hindu

"A very ordinary & simple human, sorted in mind with things that life gave me an opportunity to learn. Not a perfectionist but not a spoil sport or stupid either :) Enjoy traveling & exploring new places & cultures. 
I've done M.Sc. in mol bio & biochem from Guru Nanak Dev university, working as QA/QC in a start up Vaccine division of a biopharma company in Blr. Professionally I intend growing into an entrepreneur & would be taking up GMAT soon for pursuing MBA likely after two more years of work Exp.


Talking in terms of spirituality, I've witnessed myself going through a huge learning curve which is still in its log phase. As a child I followed mom & grandma & grew listening to stories of our Gurus from them, this inculcated in me faith & a practice of going to Gurudwara sahib; heard Ramayana, Bhagwat Gita, Swami Vivekananda, Gautam Buddha from family friends which opened me to the world of varied thought processes. Reading verses from Bible at school assembly, singing hymns & carols for church at school, campaigning for awareness camps, spending time in Cheshire homes, news paper drives for fund generation, literary club activities etc stirred me emotionally to observe the power of humanism. Then learning more on genetic evolution in my college days I went on to be a atheist; in university there was a good influence of secularism on me where I learnt a bit of Koran & now I wonder what else can be a more deeper & honest approach to our selfless conduct in life if not guided through the concept of God. I'm guided through the humbleness & simplicity of Sikhism & find peace & strength from its teachings. Like any learner, I have traveled just a few meters & have a long way to go to reason this out better. 
A very terrible singer but would never spare a ear when I come to picking notes of a song or poem :) 

I belong to a very liberal family where I was never discouraged to question & seek answers & have been blessed with all that a child could crave for, my family is my greatest strength & perhaps I would be lost without them. It's been a long while that I'm away from home due to my studies & work & long to unite back together in the same city sooner so that we can live in the colors of togetherness. I'm looking for a family where I just make friends with my in-laws & husband where each one of us feel blessed to have each others companionship. Would wish that my marriage adds more beautiful reasons & people in the journey of our lives where we stand as pillars of strength & encouragement for each other.

"About Parul (in her words)

Hi,
Thanks for your interest in my profile!

To begin with, I am a simple, sophisticated, ambitious, independent and a practical girl with high ideals. I have done B.E in Information Technology from Bhopal and currently working in Pune for a software giant.
I am privileged to have been born to a family of highly educated folks. We have an extremely close knit family consisting of mom, dad and my sis. My dad's a Doctor, my mom is an officer in SBI, and my sis is pursuing B.E in IT (placed in TCS already).

More about myself...
I am basically an ambivert person who likes to have her own space. I like to keep things short and simple. But yes, i have my other side too which likes fun as well. My idea of fun is being with friends and family, listening to music, reading, cooking, doing anything creative (art runs in my family)..etc. Nature enthralls me...i am a nature lover who takes a snap of anything and everything that appears beautiful to my eyes (beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder you see:))
Apart from this i am very caring and understanding and know my responsibilities well. My family is as important to me as my career and i am confident enough to be able to balance both of them.

This covers quite a lot about me...rest of the details in person :)!!

"Hello!!!
Thanx for stopping by.........................

Before I really start I would like to tell u that i m not just looking for the person to get married but i m looking for ""The Man of My Life; My Better Half; My Soul Mate "" as per me an individual is incomplete without his/her better half.

This is soooooooooooo difficult but let me give it a try to write about myself.............................

Well, I belong to a town called Moradabad(U. P) but residing in Faridabad along with parents for past 4years. I am an extrovert, who likes to have fun & at the same time lead a balanced life of being responsible towards my duties & roles of life. My friends & family would call me a trustworthy, sweet natured, responsible, fun loving & a balanced girl.... they all like me.. In my education I have done pretty well. I am M. Phil in English and also an M. Ed. Though basically I was a medical student and also cracked the PMT at All India Level in 1999 in first attempt but my destiny was holding something else for me. I strongly believe in destiny .........
I believe that it takes respect, understanding, space, love, and above all real communication to make a relationship sail smoothly throughout ur life ÃÂ¢&#65533;ÃÂ¦As LIFE IS A ROLLER COASTER RIDE so of course there r ups & downs in life which can be handled if both the partners are understanding towards each other. Therefore, I am looking for the one who is not only good looking.. in a way presentable, good to talk to, with whom I can share every moment of life with ease.. especially the silent ones.. I am looking for the one who is open minded and respects others point of view, is loving, caring, understanding, established & self made man... I respect family values & traditions (though I am very moderate in my thinking).. so expect the same from the one I am looking for...... Well......... this might take long so I leave a lot for when we get in touch........ For now........... thank you for taking out time to read through and wish u all the best in your search for ur better half !!!",31,Sikh - Ahluwalia,,,Private Sector,5ft 2in,farf802848,Sikh

"This is my own dream & own thoughts about my life.
& also life partner


We spend too much time looking for the right person to love or finding fault with those we already love, when instead we should be perfecting the love we give.

No one can go back and make a brand new start. Anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.


God didn?t promise days without pain, laughter, without sorrow, sun, without rain, but He did promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears, and light for the way.


Disappointments are like road bumps, they slow you down a bit but you enjoy the smooth road afterwards. Don?t stay on the bumps too long. Move on!


When you feel down because you didn?t get what you want, just sit tight and be happy, because God has thought of something better to give you.


When something happens to you, good or bad, consider what it means.

When I am passing by a church, gurudwara or masjid, my hands immediately fold into a Namaste as a mark of reverence. For me all religions are the same and lead to almighty. ItÃâs just that each one professes it in a different way. My soul mate should respect my sentiments. For a relationship to be successful, it must be based on mutual understanding. Just as I donÃât expect my partner to blindly follow my faith, he too should give me the space to follow mine.I love cricket, strolling down sarson fields, eating sugarcane and being happy all the time.I am always high on life, thereÃâs never a dull moment.

Someone with whom I can have great chemistry and complement each other in all aspect. A kind of relation where we give each other space to grow. We care enough about each other to let go of the small stuff and take the effort to sort out the big stuff. We learn to trust and love each other absolutely and unconditionally and many years down the line we can still make each other laugh. I do not want to rush into a relationship.

"I finished my residency training about two years ago and now am out in the real world working and practicing in Chicago. Medicine was a long journey and honestly, at first it was a little weird not being a student for the first time in my life. Having reached a stable point in my career I find myself more ready than ever to meet the right person for me and settle down. I grew up in West Africa, India and the US. My parents are now settled in Delhi after living and working in Africa for the last 35 years. I have one elder brother who tries to act like a third parent to me, but he is also my closest friend.
