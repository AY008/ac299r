"Greetings,
I am very fun loving and humorous, people think I am a very serious person when they meet me for the first time. I love water sports and I am a certified scuba diver too. I enjoy my diving trips to various countries and love other cuisines and visiting places; I listen to soft music and sometimes have the mood for rock. 
I come from a defense background and have travelled throughout my primary and secondary educational span. You may wonder what I am doing in the stream of IT where my qualification does not appear relevant. Give it a thought, hospitality is needed everywhere and that is what management in frontline operations, sales and technology do, managing clients and customers while the engineers manage the soft and hardware.  I am sure there is a lot to talk about and I would love to speak to you when we get a chance to speak,  either on the phone or in person. 
What I am looking for is very basic, all she needs to do speak well, should be able to carry herself well among people and look good. Family values are important, working post marriage is totally up to her. 
I am looking forward for a dialog and will await your response :)
With warm regards,

Some facts about merchant navy :
So here are some myths about sailors and sailing, along with the reality attached to it. i solemnly swear to speak the truth. so here goes:
1. Myth: Everybody gets seasick ? WRONG. this is usually the first question everyone asks. so ur in the merchant navy eh? don't u get sea sick? Sea sickness is exactly like motion sickness. Does everyone have motion sickness? NO! so why would everyone get seasick? yea people do get sea sick but not as often as normally believed. personally I've never had sea sickness and I've sailed about 11 years in some pretty hostile seas.
Sailors sail for 6 months and are off for rest of the year ? now i don't know which wise guy started this myth. A standard contract would be 3-4 months sail, then 4 months off ( depending how long u wanna stay back home) and the cycle continues. Depending on the companies. We can get into shore Job i.e 9 to 5 job, for this at present I am not interested but down the yrs yes i will join that job.
If like my profile and wanna go ahead do contact me will talk.

I have chased a corporate career for eight years. I am looking to create a life about love and happiness and peace. A life which also gives back to the society than just takes from it. I love Yoga and nature and am a keen photographer. I am looking for a partner and a companion with similar thoughts and ideas and plans in life. I do not smoke/drink and am a vegetarian by choice. But do not mind my partner enjoying these things as long as they are done in moderation. To me life is about individual choices. Having tried it once, I do not believe we can gauge our compatibility with a person through a few interactions. So I would look for someone who is willing to invest that time. If we hit it off as great companions and friends, we can consider taking it to the next level. Life is too short to be wasted. And for all the things one may want to do in life, there is always a need for warmth of a relationship, for hugs and sweet nothings, for someone to walk with in the rains, for someone to care for and care, for someone to share simple pleasures of life with. Therefore, I am looking for a committed, long-term relationship and then let the future unfold. The objective would be to make whatever distance we travel together be the time of our life.",33,,"Delhi, Delhi, India",,MNC,5ft 7in,SMM1491129,Hindu

"Well I will try to give you a clear picture about myself as of now as it will help you to check the compatibility.
I am a philosophical person, trying to realize as I participate & witness different aspects of life. Simple, semi-commercial & non religious but obviously spiritual minded & also have a
creative bent of mind.It may seem like I am a bit reserve but actually the person in my
frequency will definitely not agree to that. Also like an open book to my close ones. 
My Belief (as developed till date):
Love, Trust & Respect are 3 essentials of any understanding & healthy relationship..
- where the foundation lies on love & trust & respect has to be (earned) developed.
In relationships giving comfort zones.Firmly believe in Peace & Humanity.
I always try to apply my learning into real life situations as I believe in perfectionism.
Can face all odds (which are just like speed breakers) with courage & optimism, because life 
may not always be as smooth sailing if we see life as a journey..... What we need is 
Sheer Optimism,Complete Trust & Support from those who are mutually considered to be 
""close"" to us...
A few liking & disliking:
Intelligent talking and prefers intelligent hard-work.
Love to be with them who are Simple & Sharing.
I am the person who will not prefer to be a part of any gossips (in the office corridor, or social gatherings) or loose talks as I love to direct all my focus towards ""PURPOSEFUL ACTION"".
About My Friends: 
The old phrase ""A friend in need a friend indeed"".
I am a friendly chap ... at the same time I am very selective about my friends at personal, 
professional & social circle.
My Career:
I always prefer business as I belonged to and my upbringing was in business environment 
& is passionate about to be of my own, with full of self confidence... I am always in search of new opportunities as an entrepreneurial behavior.
At the same time flexible & confident enough to accommodate myself in jobs for the time being if 
& whenever necessary.
I had to take some forcible pauses in my career (due to fast swifts in our joint family after sudden demise of my father followed by my uncle) which I think made me more mature & pragmatic human being.
My Dream:
To live a happy family life with reasonable financial security & have a good health.
Ambitious, want to reach every Possible Heights but the Purpose, Values & Objectives need to be right in the process. 
To become a good human being and serve the humanity as much as possible and try to reach the stage of ""self actualization or enlightenment"".
Hope this will suffice my introduction.

If you think that my profile doesn't match you then it will be highly appreciated if you kindly decline my interest..... ",33,Brahmin - Barendra,,,,5ft 7in,kolm884958,Hindu

"This is the place where the reader is expecting to know what kind of person am I. However, it will be better to get the information by a person who knows me well. So I asked my nears and dears what to write here and the below is what I got in reply.
-
Hi, this is Neelabh. I am simple, family oriented, fun loving, caring, romantic and educated. I enjoy ever moment of life to fullest and love to make life simpler. I believe in respecting human rather that by their caste or creed or gender. I believe that men and women are the wheels of the vehicle called 'Society'. Both are equally important and without both being equal, you cannot expect the vehicle to function smoothly.
Life is like a sketch board for me, where we draw our imaginations, expectations and experiences. It is we who decide the flow of life, is what I believe firmly. Bing optimistic and confident, I look to grasp 'The Room above First', as there is always space to grow and improve. I accept changes that are for good and that will make me a better human.
-
When it comes to values in life, I like to be a blend of traditional and modern values, picking up 'The Best of Both the Worlds'. It is a wonderful combination when you pick the best experiences and inculcate them in real life. You have the whole world to pick experiences from, either from mistakes or from success of self or others. So why to repeat the mistakes, rather take the smarter path of being a supportive part of world.
-
I believe in equality and so my soul mate can expect me in every time of need and want with her. She will be secure and happy in my company, for sure. And that's a gentleman's promise. Also to mention, I love cooking and experimenting new things, so will be help in her daily kitchen too. Hope this makes her happier and helps to get more time together, helping and understanding each other, constantly, sharing day-to-day experience and thoughts.

Our family values are Moderate..

As you are already aware that I am a Divorced person, (The reasons for which I think can best be explained and understood only once we meet/talk mutually), I only wish to state here that I am looking for only a single quality in my better half, i.e., she should be honest..honest to herself..honest to the relationship she is entering into..and must have faith and belief in her husband and his Family... She should be willing to accept the fact, that she is not losing anything by getting married, but infact, she is gaining much more in terms of the immense love in the form of new parents, her In-laws, and an ever loving and caring Husband.. In short, she must be willing to forgo her past, (bitter or sweet), and must be willing to mingle and welcome her new life with full faith and belief..

I sing loud in car (generally, Bollywood goldies), go for camping in summer and do not mind walking in the rain. Traveling is another recent bug in the system, driving around, dining out, sunny-Sunday-morning breakfast in a roadside cafe, strolling on beach, hiking, bush walking, relaxed evenings with mates, or gazing stars in clear and serene nights are few things I like to do. I am a Lecturer in Finance by profession and in absolute love with my job. Apart from good work life balance that I get, I reckon it is a noble profession whereby I can make direct contributions to peoples' life and society. I am currently pursuing PhD and CFA(USA) at the moment. A simple and wonderful life I lead and envision too. ",33,Maheshwari,"Melbourne, Victoria",,Private Sector,5ft 8in,Vineet_Mel_Au_Indian,Hindu

"I'm a broad minded, largely social person and who loves the outdoors. I'm not much of a book reader but I'm open to learning new ideas through conversations and art forms. I indulge to a large extent in outdoor and adventure sports. In food, again I have range from the international to the Brahmin cuisine. I would neatly fit the popular wisdom among women - 'the key to a man's heart is through his stomach'. I have decent sense of dressing and buying good clothes and dressing according to the demands of the occasion matters to me. I love to cook, especially for loved ones.  Friends matter to me and they come in all varieties.

I'm not entirely pompous or averse to simplicity, i can do both. While I do have a problem with my spending habits, I'm open to be gently advised and guided on it. I'm sensitive to people's feelings and am careful in the way I refuse something to anyone.

I'm ambitious but I'm not focused on simply money or playing it according to the rules of the rat race. Work has to be a source of joy and not merely a place to make money. I have a holistic view of life in which career is only one of the essential parts. My approach is to be good at what I do and i always look to upgrade if i sense the need for it. I'm not one to try an alternative merely for the sake of change or by way of peer pressure.

I don't have a rigid moral view on most matters. I approach matters practically with particular focus on whether any person's feelings are hurt. Harmony among relationships is very important to me in deciding the right thing to do. Insofar as life philosophy is concerned, I'm a guy who likes to go where the path takes him while enjoying the breeze, flowers, fruits, shade and butterflies. It follows that I make my 'destinations' on the go without being too rigid about them.  I'm not terribly religious and spiritual, neither am I materialistic. I indulge in the good things of life if they are affordable and help in creating harmony. But I do not crave after them as if my esteem depends on them. I believe in God.

"Having said less about it, my sense of humor will say much more about me than my external appearance.  I am a fun loving person always with a smile on my face as I believe it is the greatest problem solver in the world.  People usually get a good notion about me with a first meet.  And I believe in the fact problems will always persist in life no matter how many you overcome, but they never last long. 

I have always been the master of my own world and pursued everything as I decided and as it took me around. I am a person who likes hands on experience things to do and hence I have planned my entire career in materials engineering. I am usually curious about how things must have been made and that may require some patience for the others to understand me (just kidding !!).   My passion has been the automotive industry and to my fortune I am pursuing my career in the same.  I work at TACO, TECH Center as a project engineer over new product developments pertaining to automotive plastics. I would like to mention an interesting fact that I work on Tata Motors 1 Lakh car.   

I love traveling different parts of India and the sometimes I get chances to visit different parts of the world. I am really compassionate about that. I love outdoor actives like cycling, trekking, hiking or I can just walk over a few miles with my player.  I am a true family person. 

I dont fit in the definition of tall dark and handsome but i will phrase myself as short, fair and handsome Baldy :-)

I am an extremely open person and strongly believe in freedom of an individual. I try to be principled and regular in my own work. Born in a business family I have a burning desire for an entrepreneurship and intend to venture in the fiend of electronic materials/ plastics as my area of specialization. Having this dream since my childhood I came back from the US with required knowledge of the same .At present I am trying to grasp the trends in Indian market and an opportunity to foray in business.

He is very humble and has deep respect and understanding for women. He is loving, caring and supportive. He loves home food and is crazy about movies and digital photography. He lives in downtown Hong Kong and maintains a hectic schedule between work, friends and personal development time.

[About his education]:
He finished his entire schooling from Mumbai with flying colors. Wanting to learn living independently, he opted to do his Computer Engineering from Pune, away from home. After getting some work experience in India and abroad, planning for the future, he invested two year in his Executive Finance MBA from the well known Canadian University, McGill. He did his MBA while working at the same time and was full funded by him.

[About his work]:
He is quite ambitious and plans for the longer term. He has just moved to Hong Kong from Tokyo, where, he was based since the last eight years. He is working as Vice-President in Front office, Prime Brokerage business of Barclays Capital, one of the biggest and most successful investment banks of recent times. His career in investment banking has seen a stupendous growth, a testament to his hard work and planning.

He started his career in Pune. He was hand picked from his college by Sungard, an American financial services giant, in 2001 when, just after 9/11, no jobs were around. Just after a year, he was moved to London, with a fat package, to take charge of the company's latest stock trading platform for London Stock Exchange.

On his return, he had a short stint with JPMorgan, after which, Barclays gave him a juicy offer and permanently relocated him to Japan.

About what i do for living? Iam currently working as Test Manager for a leading MNC. Me and my family are pretty well settled in Chennai. Me and my family lived in Pathankot, Bangalore, Pune and Delhi before eventually coming to Chennai. So Hindi comes naturally and apart from that i understand Telugu and Malayalam. I am a complete movie buff and love music.Travelling has always excited me and has had the luxury of being in London and quite a few cities in the US. My Job gave me that incentive to accomplishing my passion in travelling..There is something special about visiting a new place or trying out something new in life. Guess its just one life why not live it to the fullest.

	 I am expressive and a creative person at heart, a simple guy with simple principle in life- ""Live Life When u r Alive"". Well easily said than done but i just strive to live upto it.

"Hi, This is not yet another of those routine profiles that u see, so read carefully on... 

Let me begin by mentioning something important here - 
It surprises me no end to find a lot of women boasting of different personal qualities like being simple, down to earth, understanding, loving, caring, smart, intelligent, good looking and so on and on and on... 
Well just a word of advice - No bloke is ever going to believe what u say about urself, unless he is low on intelligence. What matters is how he finds u after he gets to know u. No matter how u describe urself, its just ur photograph, age and social standing that almost always seals the initial decision to select u !! The rest of ur 'self-description' is simply ignored, or sometimes not even read !!! Thats just normal human tendency. The major part of the opinion about u is formed gradually in the course of interactions that follow. 
And then we have ladies who announce they prefer partners who r loving, understanding, caring, sensitive, smart, down to earth, friendly etc etc blah blah.. 
Well thats not a special, 'out- of- the- world' choice u've got -- thats what every woman is looking for, so u might as well just not mention it. 

now here's a few details about my turn of mind i'd urge u to consider before going for me :
I'd much rather have a woman reject me instantly than keep me waiting long. 
Its all very well to imagine that the slower the decision, the more sensible it is -- but the fact remains, that the quicker the decision, the more genuine and honest is the underlying attraction !! If u r not quick enough to decide on me, then either I dont deserve u, OR u r not worth waiting for ! [ usually, the former is true ! ] -- In most cases a slow decision is nothing but the process of trying to convince urself in someone's favour even though he may not be favourable ! Its never about how compatible we r before marriage but how we deal with incompatibility after. The fun lies in hitting it off inspite of differences, so think twice before u say that u want ur partner to be like this and like that. 

I stay with mom and dad in Andheri, Mumbai. 
Its a 2 bedroom apartment on the 5th floor. I have a pet dog called Robin. 
We have another 1 bedroom apt. just a few minutes away which is currently rented out. 

Just took a bit long sorting out my career, which is firmly in place now - so marriage plans had to be held back. 

I reserve the highest passion for clothes, perfumes and watches - my eternal weakness ( although those will have to make way for 'Miss Right' !! ) 
I cant resist material pleasures and stop at nothing to buy anything that catches my fancy. 

Im not the highly ambitious sort - i've never been - 
Its a little tricky to set ambitions and go after it when u're too busy
enjoying life ! 

My prized possession today is the unforgettable scent of a perfume gifted to me years ago. Memories of the gifter have long faded away but somewhere deep inside me, the fragrance still lingers on !!

About my eating habits- I have a racing appetite for food, and prefer home food, like those cooked by mom and sis - 
I'd rather starve than eat junk food, but I do have a sweet tooth, infact not just one, but around 32 sweet teeth !! I just gobble up whatever sweet i can lay my hands on. [ So, i dont want my wife to be too sweet ! ]

The almighty has always showered me with THE BEST in this world... 
So i hope THE BEST WIFE is on her way too !!!
=========================================
1 final point -
All u ladies with a tendency to make a show of ur 'care less' attitude by taking ur own time to respond to messages etc, or on the pretext of being too busy blah blah blah --
As much as ur style impresses me, please.. KEEP AWAY ! 

The rest of u - simple, graceful, unpretentious gentlewomen, 
U have my highest welcome.

"Having passed graduation in India, I pursued my PG Diplomas in Mgt. in London (East London 'varsity). My elder brother also did his MS there.
Both of us were born and brought up in Hyderabad. We have our own house at Hyderabad. My elder brother is married and settled in Bangalore at present. My sister in law is B.E., MBA and at present a homemaker. We are a close knit family who value and cherish relationship. We were groomed in pious and virtuous culture and by virtue of our extended stay in metros we are liberal too. By nature I am a bit reserved and would like to concentrate on the job at hand. I have ambitions to climb the ladder of my career and hopefully and honestly working in that direction.Ambitions, goals and dreams can only be realised by hardwork and therefore I am a devoted worker in my profession and thankfully rewarded for my past exposures.Though I have had many opportunities for work abroad I preferred to be with my parents in the evening of their life. I feel I am indebted to my parents for their affection and sacrifice to see that I raise in my career to a comfortable position today. I owe all my achievements to my parents and teachers and I can seldom repay them in my life-time. So I feel by remaining with them I can foster the ideals of caring parents in their old-age. Our relatives are spread all over India and abroad. I used to play cricket but I rarely get time nowadays to indulge in that nowadays. I like good food and good music but can manage as the situations warrant. People say that I am an introvert as I believe in the principle of 'TALK LESS WORK MORE'; because that is the route to real success. I believe that matrimony is not just a ritual but a life-long relationship which fosters and paves way for greater achievements collectively for the welfare and advancement of family happiness. I respect elders not only for their age but also for their experience and ideals, as we evidently know that 'an ounce of practice is better than tons of theory'. I will very much appreciate if my prospective life-partner if she would co-operate with me to realise my dreams and ambitions in life. The relationship should mean 'parnership for perfection' 
for a peaceful living. Money is of course important but we should realise money alone is not important in life. I believe that open mindedness is a tool for solving many differences of opinions. I respect and listen to the views of others and at the same time I am guided by the dictates of my conscience before taking any decision. What is good for all is more important than what is good for me! The life revolves with hopes as the centrifugal force and we should accept the results of our deeds and results of our decisions of the past. Family welfare and prosperity is foremost in our day to day living.

I like to keep fit... Running is my favourite fitness activity but I do hit the gym often and also practice martial arts when I get the time... On weekends I prefer trekking or photography trips and make it a point to do this at least a couple of times a month. They give me a break from the stress and chaos of city life... I also love beaches and going on long drives...

When it comes to movies I mostly watch sci-fi, action & thrillers but I do check out the other genres once in a while.. My taste in music is very varied and I enjoy listening to anything but the new age bollywood stuff ..

I am from Delhi but working in Singapore's largest private info-communication company as a Software Engineer, Alhamdulillah. I m Singapore Permanent Resident. I did my schooling and Engineering Degree from Delhi and Diploma from University of London. I dream to create a happy family in which the atmosphere of Love, care and mutual understanding will reign. I never smoke and drink and I'll never do in my life. I am very soft, down to earth,fun-loving,ambitious,simple, kind-hearted, friendly, frank, honest, generous, helping and clean hearted person who never maintain ego. I love travelling around the globe. I have travelled many places like Germany, Sweeden,Malysia, Singapore, Dubai,Morocco and some Arab countries and many cities in India. I love to extend helping hands always without thinking for return. Becoz, I want return from Allah only. I don't know but my friends say, I am very romantic guyÃ¯?Å . I try to learn from past mistakes and try to improve. Little bit talkative to those whom I care a lot. Like everyone, I also have my areas of improvement. So, I love to hear constructive criticisms from anyone who is junior or senior to me. A lot of abstract qualities that u can feel when u talk to me but can't express in words. No one is perfect but I want to go towards perfection day by day, want to become better and better human being, have a strong passion to go higher and higher but not dying to achieve everything on earth but never stop struggling. I don't feel shy to say sorry if I commit something wrong or if I hurt someone. I like to face challenges and consider nothing is impossible. I always want discussion before doing something if I have someone to discuss. I really respect all human beings irrespective of status. I always try to be good even to those whom I don't like. If I don't like someone, I don't fight or quarrel but I distance myself from him/her. I fight only when situation forces me. I respect others' feelings and emotions. If someone hurts me I directly say. I feel if I keep everything secretly inside my heart without being expressed, it will blast one day. I try to understand someone who doesn't speak up and try to come up with what he/she expects from me. I offer 5 times salat n observe other pillars of Islam like fasting,zakat. I love swimming, shopping, seeing romantic and comedy movies, singing. I'm not very materialistic. I don't run after money by hook or crook but I want to be a very rich man like Bill Gates with my efforts so that I can do something for the needy. But, I'm not dying to achieve it. If I achieve it's good, if not ok. I can satisfy with what I have.I have a soul with various dimensions, a deep soul, yet enchanting, interesting, exciting and overwhelming. I am a deep thinker. I think, every statement has two meanings- positive and negative. I always try to take in positive way. I would like to make you believe that I am different from any other man you have met or will meet. Do you want to walk the great walk of life with someone special who is as deep as me?If so then I am your prince, but you must know plus and minus both to lead a happy and understanding relationship.My Family: I belong to a very religious and respected family.

"There are several shades of a human personality that cannot be condensed in to words. Any assessment of my self can result in an understatement or exaggeration. However, due to the nature of this profile, I?ll try doing the expected.

I'm a self motivated, loving, affectionate, extrovert, well-balanced & independent. I?ll take life as it comes. An adaptable & pleasing personality currently working in one of the best Iron & Steel producing Company of Middle East (gulf). 

To me ""Marriage? is a strong bond to be nurtured always with love & mutual understanding all along."" The difference between ordinary & extra-ordinary is the little EXTRA. A little extra that goes on a very long way. I look to put in that extra in a relationship & am searching for a soul mate who would share similar thoughts. I'm not looking for the one I can live with but the one I just can?t live without.

While there is no perfect person; I think everyone has a checklist of qualities that are really important to them. I suppose my ""would be"" should have certain distinctions in her; those are intelligence, loving, well-educated, loyal above all humorous and witty, from a good family background with sound morals, values & aspirations in life. Someone who could mould herself and switch easily between cultures, modern and simple cosmopolitan, set along and walk beside me.
