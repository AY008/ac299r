Looking for someone who will be friend forever. Beauty fades away, its only compatibility, trust, understanding and true love that works in the long run.

"Its hard to describe about self, but shall try.Believe me, this is not any kind of exageration but  simple truth, coz marriage is a life time commitment.
Well, to start with - I have a pleasing personality( that's what my friends comment) and get along well with people, a bit choosy when it comes to friends coz I am frank and open and hate gossips. I am sincere in my work and well desciplined. My goal in life is to lead a life pleasing to the Lord. 
I am a malayali , born and brought up in MP and my parents have been here in MP for about 45 yrs & they have  No plans of going back to Kerala. They are the members of a christian organization which is a hospital (60 bedded multi speciality hospital ) run by few members and my parents are one among the members. We live in a campus and all the members stay together with their children and grand children as a family. It is not a kind of  posh or luxurious kind of living , but we lead  and live in a simple, humble and christ centered atmosphere.
I did my schooling from a convent in MP and then joined for my professional course( Diploma in Medical Lab Technology ) in New Delhi, completed and then came back to MP and presently working in the same hospital with my parents. I am managing the pathology Department of our hospital. I did my MA in sociology(Bhopal University)while I was working,  as part of my interest to study.
My parents are basically CSI which according to me is just a man made name tag coz God did not create us with labels but created us in His own likeness and image. People probe into many aspects like caste, creed, denomination when it comes to marriage but that does'nt count at all when you enter into the kingdom of God. All that matters is to do His Will. So - Men under parental pressures for money, fame etc -- can exclude me ! The Bible says : 
There is neither Greek nor Jew but Christ is all and in all and we are all one in Him ( col 3 : 11 ) - a person with this motto is wecome to  approach me.
We go to a Methodist Church here for worship coz we have been here since ages.I have been baptized and like to have fellowship with the believers. I can only talk in Malayalam but cannot write or read. I am fluent with Hindi and of course English. I take part in Church activities and do sing in the  church choir.
I like to dress up well. I love to wear Jeans coz I feel much comfortable with that especially for a casual outing / walk in the morning or when I am on my 2 wheeler but not to Church anyway.
I do not know much cooking because we have been brought up in an Organization where food is cooked for all the members together by the cooks appointed and we don't have to do any cooking.But I sure can learn it in the near future.
I am a jovial person and can mingle well if I get a proper feed back. I can make a home  a real sweet home. 
Keeping adjustments in view , I would prefer a life partner who is a Malayali - settled outside kerala like me, who should be a  god fearing christian and  a believer with clean habits and a person who will hold my hand in every walk of  life.I know that when God gives - He always gives the best to His children who put their trust in Him.
I think, I have written loads and should stop now. Rest and next when we meet in person. 
God bless U & your family.",37,,,,Private Sector,5ft,liz21,Christian

"I come from a sweet and nice family of four. Have swam across little tit bits of life with some difficulties and a bit of determination. Am quite ambitious in my own way and largely inspired by mom, brother, nature and of course life. Have seen most of the life's attributes. Dad is a retired army person with his entire life gifted to social work. Mom is a great homemaker. Bro is currently heading sales operation for India in one of the CRM companies and have chosen to create names for all and fame with it. Am a bit moody and quite a lot of time bubbly person. I would like to take life as it comes but yes also expect some tit bits of miracles.
