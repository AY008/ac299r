I like listening to both English and Hindi music, it helps me unwind. I enjoy watching movies, but, only in the multiplex. Like every other girl, i love to indulge myself in shopping! My life's mantra is to enjoy it to the fullest and cherish every day of this precious gift bestowed to us by the Almighty. Being a Leo gal, I hold a classic and Royal taste for things in life.

I have a liberal attitude, with a dash of Indian tradition. I'm also a religious person. Though I'm not too fond of cooking, but, my culinary abilities are worth a try! 

I strongly believe that each and every individual has a different identity and differ in their thinking as well. No two people are alike. So, their personalities also differ in many ways. 

I am presently working as a teacher in the prestigious Shriram Millenium School. In future, I would appreciate a partner who supports me in whatever I plan (i.e., to work after marriage or not).

Now here comes THE MOST IMPORTANT part! PLEASE read it VERY CAREFULLY!

I'm looking for a partner who would treat me like a 'Princess' (literally).
He should be mature but, at the same time he must posses a good sense of humor. Jovial, loving, caring, romantic, supportive,fun loving,adventurous, full of life... ""well settled"", and most of all, he should have eyes only for 'me'.

Ofcourse (it goes without saying), I too shall offer the same to my partner. Most of all i shall bring along with me loads of love, warmth and respect for him and his family (as my family would obviously be the most important thing for me).

Last but not the least, people who believe in DOWRY should strictly Stay Away from ME because I don't support such anti-social practices!

It is a lifelong celebration of compatibilities and the reconciliation of incompatibilities. As for a partner, I need someone who would accept me with all my negative aspects and help me turn them into positives attributes for the mutual benefit of both. Some thoughts pertaining to a suitable partner are as under. I have not got much, nor in life do I need too many. All I want is to hold someone?s hands gently, And walk through this life rainy or sunny. All I need is a little understanding, love and care. And someone who says I am always there.

"I am a simple girl with simple thoughts not very liberal and not too conservative either, I believe in a lot of philosophy? most of which I do not follow myself.

At first I may come across as a snob who does not like to mingle with others?but all that I can say is that I am a coconut?sturdy from the outside and all warm and sweet from within. Once I get to know someone I reveal the sweet and soft me, till then I am an unbroken coconut shell. People find it strange as their views about me change from negative to positive once they get to know me, till then I am just a mystery to all.
You can always get to know me more by becoming my friend?believe me there is lots to tell.
When it comes to speaking about my likes and dislikes, I would say that I love creativity in all forms?art, crafts, music, writing, even food for that matter. I love humor, that is one stress buster that can get you out of any situation with ease?it does not mean that I do not get tensed?I am one of a kind who gets all hyper about an accident on some street that I don?t even know of. 
I would want my partner to be very down to earth person?kind, respectful and chivalrous. He should be God fearing and full of love and warmth. He should like to talk as I do not talk much but, he should also be a good listener when I feel like talking. He should accept me the way I am without any alterations?and most important he should have a strong heart to tolerate the unexpected things that keep happening with me.

"This what my daughter has to share. Well I come from a middle class family which comprises of my father who works in India Navy, Mother who is a house wife & 3 younger sisters. I was born in Mumbai but since my father works in Indian Navy & has a transferable job so we moved to Vishakhapatnam & stayed there for more than a decade. So, I spend most of my childhood there.
Thereafter, we moved to Mumbai again (due to Dad's transfer). I am a CBSE student so it dint affect my studies much rather its been an interesting journey that gave me an opportunity to meet different people to learn from them. About My Education: I did MBA (Marketing) from VIM, Pune University & B.Sc. [Computer Science] from D.G. Ruparel College, Mumbai. My Hobbies are Dancing, listening to music, painting, traveling, yoga, reading, photography & spending time with kids. I am passionate about dancing. I have been dancing from the school days. So, you can say Music, rains & kids are my poison. I like to travel and some of the places I have been to include Mysore, Bangalore, Kanyakumari, Hyderabad, Madurai, Chennai, etc. I have learned Yoga during my graduation & my new passion is photography.

Aman values love and friendships and has a great respect for her faith. We are fortunate to be able to serve maharaj de swaroop at home and since the passing of our parents, she has adopted this responsibility.

In her free time, she enjoys reading, cooking and watching movies. Her favourite genres are comedy, romance and thrillers. She also enjoys watching t20 cricket and playing on the wii. Aman is fun loving and as she is the baby of the family, has a very impish charm. she can be very fun-loving, likes to jest but is also serious. she is versitile and knows how to behave/react in various situations.

Ideally, her life partner will have strong family values, be hard-working, respectful and sympathetic to the fact that she has lost both her parents at such an early age. He must also respect her strong bond with her remaining family and the closeness we share. She is not too concerned with clean-shaven or turban but insists that there is respect of the fact that we do have the guru granth sahib at home and her responsibilities to this effect. but remember that this does not mean that she doesn't enjoy going out and having a laugh too.

"Hello Every1 !! Thanks for stopping by  my profile. 
I would describe myself as a happy go lucky kinda person, I am usually in high spirits & believe in making  most of every moment. don't believe  in planning bcoz now when i look back i realise that nothing in my life has happened as per my plan. And i am happy that some of my plans have really not worked.  I take life as it comes, believe in Karma, good deeds more than anything. An extrovert, I can break into a conversation with a stranger easily but at times I find myself at loss of words when i am to speak to some1 i know.
My interests include reading,watching movies,travelling.I have a list of places that i would want to visit before i bid final adieu to Mother Earth. I love to read & most of the time u will find me with a book/newspaper/magazine...I picked up reading late in life..and this is one thing i regret badly. Now at times I feel there is so much to read..n i have less time. A Good Movie makes my day, usually I spend weekends watching movies at home.and at times..when i totally love the movie..i end up writing about it..and then i think of becoming a film critic..:p and thats how it goes.. 
i really liked the HUM=TUM concept..although all my married friends n relatives tell me that all this looks good on papers.. reality is opposite, but i have seen exceptions & i believe that its difficult to find like minded people easily..but then whats the point in getting things easily.. i am ready to give myself time..Good Things Can Happen Even Late in Life..so no hurry.
I really cant describe my life partner in details but..some1 with whom i don't have to weigh my thoughts or watch my words..some1 who is not judgmental..gives me my space.. I think that's more than enough. No high expectations..as I know very well that it hurts when expectations fail.
Thats it about me. 
Happy Searching !!

"Hi, I'm Anusha. 29 years old. I won't say I'm smart & intelligent that everyone is in their own way. I think I've a pretty balanced personality. I am practical, confident at the same time I?m emotional & caring too. I can keep my cool in tough situations at the same time I get angry also. I'm a straightforward person in conversing however I?m very bad at expressing my feelings. I?m very family oriented person. I?m honest & dedicated towards my relations. Though my Facebook page has long lists of my friends from School, Jr. College, Office circles ? very few are counted as close friends. I can be tagged as a loner because I take time to get along with any new person, I just can walk up to someone & strike a conversation. I'm very bad at that. My hobbies include music, photography, reading & cooking. I?m an ardent Pet Lover. I have 2 pets at my home & would love to own them in future too. I am a Bengali at heart too, I value my traditions but I'm not orthodox. I'm a total foodie. I have completed my H.Sc in Arts faculty from Mumbai Board, due to some circumstantial issues I couldn't complete my graduation right after my H.Sc however I intend to do it now. I have already cleared my 2nd year of B.A from Sikkim Manipal University & now I am preparing for my 3rd year. I have been working with Uttam Galva Steels Ltd., Mumbai since 2007. Since last 1 Â½ half year I've been a part of their very prestigious SAP project. I would like to continue working after marriage also as I want to support my parents on my own. I am overweight, but I follow a healthy lifestyle & regular fitness regime. ",29,Bengali,"Kalyan, Maharashtra, India",Other General University,Private Sector,5ft 6in,kalf1095123,Hindu
