"I am a very well-balanced individual. I am fun loving, easy going and rational person who is always open to new ideas and other people's opinions. I enjoy a lot of different things and lead a very active, adventurous and enterprising life. On a regular basis I play a variety of sports(golf, tennis, etc.) and take part in other outdoor activities like hiking, trekking, bycycling, etc. I also take regular self improvement and development classes, volunteer 2-3 times a week, and there is almost nothing that I won't try at least once.
 
I was born and raised in India and came to US in 1992 to do my Masters in Computer Science. My Dad was an officer in Air Force and so we lived all over India. I think this experience has made every member of my family very cosmopolitan and open-minded. This has also resulted in my Hindi being better than my mother tongue Kannada/Telugu. And since I have been living in US for more than 15 years now, I am the perfect embodiment of the cliche 'good blend of east and west' :-)
 
I love traveling and have traveled extensively all over India and US and am now planning on seeing rest of the world. I like cooking and am always trying new recipes. I also enjoy eating out and trying new restaurants and cuisines. I generally lead a very healthy life style - except for 1 evening a week :-). I workout in the gym about 4-5 times a week. I do have my crazy and wild side as well and have done Scuba diving, Sky diving, Bungee jumping, white water rafting, paragliding, parasailing, snorkeling, etc.

Although success in work and career are important to me, my personal life always comes first. I still strongly believe in the institution of marriage and am looking for someone who also has her priorities straight in life.

"I have come into this life equipped with great curiosity, a lively, versatile, inquisitive mind, and an urge for constant learning and new experiences.  
My drive is to communicate, to make connections and association (between people or ideas), and to develop your gift for language and 
expressing yourself through the spoken or written word. Being an intermediary or messenger, a translator, a teacher, a broadcaster, 
a correspondent, or in some field where I can mix and mingle and interact with a broad spectrum of people, suits me well. Find out more when we meet

Fascinated by life's seemingly endless variety and the multitude of options and choices available to me, I have flit from one person, job, hobby, 
or location to the next, restlessly seeking new experiences and stimuli.  Even i do not do this in my outward behavior, inwardly my mind is 
in constant motion, and require a healthy dose of variation and mental or social stimulation in life in order to approach anything resembling 
contentment. Skimming lightly over the surface of life, however, can lead to a shallowness of understanding and a fluttering away of my energies.

"At 185 centimeters, I tend to stand out walking among the crowd in Bangkok, the place I was born and where I now live. I spent my childhood here until I was 9 years old, when I went to India to receive my secondary education and learn about my Indian heritage. Then off to the USA for my university degrees. But Thailand is always home to me. 

I was a commercial pilot but had to give it up to take care of my family's real-estate business. I do miss it sometimes, the feeling of flying, being in the cockpit, in control and taking on the responsibility. On occasions, I still fly, but most of the time I just take my Harley Fatboy out for a ride about town, especially during the cool months. 

I am quite busy with work but I always make time at the end of the day to hit the gym to unwind. My weekends are pure relaxation and fun like hanging out with my buddies, chilling at home and seeing some movies. I see my parents often. We would watch Indian movies together and have a good conversation over a nice meal. They always ask me when I would find a nice girl to be with. My reply to them is always, ' What is a few years wait for a lifetime of happiness?'. They would just smile. 

I do believe in fate. All around me I see couples who have met in most unlikely of places under most unique circumstances. When it is time, fate brings two people together doesn't matter how far apart they are. But the trick is to see the signs or you'd wasted the chance for life's happiness. 

I am a romantic. There, I am not ashamed to admit it. I love a woman with beautiful smile who can light up a room with her radiance and a laugh that sings like beautiful music. I prefer a traditional Indian woman who is not afraid to break tradition once in a while. Live on the wild side a little. ;)",43,,Others,,,6ft 2in,kahinhoga_in,Sikh
