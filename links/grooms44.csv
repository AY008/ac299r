"This must be one of the most difficult things I have tried to do. I am attempting to describe in this space a work in progress. ThatÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢s how I see myself. 

I believe that things happen for a reason and the people you meet in life are people you are meant to meet at that point of your life. I have dreams and ambitions but IÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢ll leave those for later. 

I like my work- on good days I feel like a fraud for taking money to do a job that gives me so much pleasure. But this is on good days, on bad days- m not paid enough to put up with the nonsense I have to deal with! 

I am not a party animal. When I go out I prefer to spend time with people I know well. We could do anything from just staying home, watching a movie, to dancing the night away (been a while since I did that- but I can still remember it!), or experimenting with food. I like eating different cuisines. 

I have been told that I have an off beat sense of humour. ItÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢s kind of weird, sarcastic and sometimes downright dark. It takes getting used to. 

I cherish my family and friends. I feel blessed and honoured to have them in my life. 

Stuff I like
Music: Santana, Elvis, Kenny Rogers, , Dinsey Movie Tunes, UB40, music with Soul and music I can sing along with.... 
 have to mention I like reading comic strips my favourite-Calvin & Hobbes

I love to travel. I have to plan my holidays - lots of places I want to experience; like the Himalayas Hemkund sahab in Himachal, Kashmir, Amazon rain forests, Peru, Venice, Milan, Egypt, Ladak, the small South-East Asian countries where I can backpack, live like a local and just beÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦.. Work gets in the way!!

I relax by hanging out with friends. I can discuss anything on this earth but discussions should not turn into a argument just for the sake of winning. 
What I am looking for in my soulmate-..... Honesty above all. She must love to cook (need not be edible) so that I can learn from her, know how to have fun, be able to sit still at peace with herself say everything and nothing in silence. A romantic streak would be helpful and appreciated! Must have a wacky sense of humour. Someone who is ready to except her mistakes gracefully ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦
