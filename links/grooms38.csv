I must have seen ""Shawshank Redemption"" a 100 times I think :D Other hobbies include watching (and occasionally playing)sports, and working out at the gym. I ran the shorter distance (5.7  km)in the recent Bangalore 10K run. I also love surfing the net and reading (mostly racy fiction novels-Jeffrey Archer,John Grisham,Sidney Sheldon etc). I have completed a basic Kannada course, hoping to attain a measure of fluency in that language pretty soon, And I do intend to learn to play at least one musical instrument sometime in the future. Looking for an early marriage, so spending considerable time these days on marriage portals, in a desperate search for my elusive soul-mate. For now, I like to think that my partner would be the center of my universe, and that I would find my happiness in hers.Thanks for reading through this rather dull description.

"Qualification

Executive MBA from International Management Institute, New Delhi
Bachelors of Arts, Delhi University




Born & brought up in Delhi ours has been a close knit nuclear family, now settled in Mumbai .

I chose hospitality industry to start my Career & got my first major break with a US based Cruise lines Royal Caribbean International - headquartered at Miami Florida. I have been to more than 50 countries & cherish the experiences I have had. 

I enjoyed traveling & at the same time wanted to have a stable base. Just like a compass that would cover the entire circle knowing fully well the needle at the centre would be a reliable base. Around me, I observed the futility of chasing money & living life away from the ones you love. 

Just like a stream, I realized the need to move on. Coming back I completed my Executive MBA from International Management Institute in New Delhi. 

Thus I embarked on a new journey; it has taken me time to consolidate my position again. I very much enjoy what I do today & added to it the satisfaction of coming home at the end of the day (the smallest of pleasures in life that we just take for granted) & spending time with the ones who matter the most.

"Hi there - thanks for stopping by to view my profile. Its a little tough to describe oneself, but can say that I am a confident, fun-loving and caring person having a positive attitude towards life. I am a bit emotional and at times do take my time to open up to people and once the comfort level is established, then things get easy. Given the flexibility offered in today's world by the Internet, thought of trying this medium to find a 'better half'. 

Am a qualified Chartered Accountant and have also completed an MBA from a reputed Indian B School. Prior to MBA, I was working with a reputed MNC (ie a big 4 accounting firm) and post MBA, I have been working with an investment banking outfit based out of India and the US. I do aspire to be successful on the professional front but at the same time strive to maintain a work - life balance. 

My hobbies include listening to music, watching movies / TV, hanging out with friends, reading et al. These are some of the things I indulge in during weekends and holidays. Am also fond of sports, especially cricket, tennis and chess. I also like to travel and visit new places. 

What am I looking for in a life partner? At the end of the day, I feel its compatibility and trust which matter most in a relationship. I am looking for a partner who is on the same wavelength as me - someone with whom I can get along well with and who can be my best friend for life. Having a great sense of humour coupled with a positive outlook would be awesome!. I would certainly like to know the person better before taking a decision to move ahead on matrimony. 

Guess we can get to know more about each other upon contact and whether things work out or not would depend upon the level of comfort we share with each other. Also, to clarify that I am a non smoker and a teetotaler and we do not believe in the dowry system. 

All the very best for your search.

My family is an orbit and all my activities in professional life revolve round it. I love to nurture my family by creating an atmosphere of harmony and love.

Inspiration and ambition are the success mantra for me.  Until and unless a person does not have any ambition to achieve his or her goal, success never comes.

I am a result oriented man and I always go ahead in all circumstances keeping a solution centric approach. 
Religion has great space in my life. I get all my strengths from him and he guides me all the time. Veneration towards my religion has created a different perception of marriage for me. Marriage is sanctified shell where two souls are kept. Love and respect for each other are the elements to maintain the purity of marriage.

"1.	I hold a Masters and M.Phil degree in English, and a Masters in Philosophy from Delhi University. Currently, I am writing my Doctoral dissertation in Philosophy from J.N.U. I am a lecturer in English in a reputed Delhi University College and also teach Philosophy in JNU, occasionally.

I have published three books, one of them read and received internationally. I write poetry, drama, fiction, and, academic/quasi-academic writing. I have also written around twenty documentaries for television, besides writing papers for national and international seminars.

My interest is music: Classical Western and Indian, and Indian films. I also like to discover new places, and am ambivert by nature. I like going out as much as I enjoy staying home, and enjoying company as much as exploring the depth of solitude. I like making friends but am selective about it. I believe in committed and long term/mutually reciprocative relationships in all spheres of life. Obviously, my interest is serious reading and writing. I respect character and creativity, and respect for human values and people above all else.

I am not materialistic in life: this does not mean that I have transcended all material desire but only that it is second to creative, intellectual and spiritual calling. I cannot go alongwith people who hold money above everything else and are under the illusion of power. Honestly speaking, I get irritated with people who contribute to banality and travesty, and are drawn to the self-destructive page 3 culture. I believe that our professional and personal life should be meaningful, and one that contributes to ourself and the other. If you believe in leading a life that gives ample time for family and friends, if you pursue a creative and intellectual sense of being, if the warmth of family time transcends crude professional interests, and if you are above the pretence of money making and black professionalism, I may be the one for you, as much as you for me.

2.	I earnestly contribute to marriage as an institution. I believe that it contributes to social, individual and domestic well being. I am not proposing that I in any sense undervalue those who choose to stay out of marriage or opt for alternative modes of companionshipÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ I only wish to assert that I am drawn to marriage naturally, as also in a well-thought after manner, and not because I am led by any social herd instinct towards it. 

3.	I believe that one should only marry that person whom one is proud to realize as oneÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢s spouse. If one marries oneÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢s partner with even a minimum compromise, it is bound to be detrimental to the relationship. I also believe that marriage is successful only if both partners respect each other, have the ability to adjust to the otherÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢s needs without relinquishing oneÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢s own, and are able to give way to a sense of real togetherness.

4.	I am very romantic towards marriage, and really believe that it is all about closeness  and acceptance in all perspectives. Marriage is all about the sweetness of love, the magic of all those little and big moments of togetherness. Anyone who takes marriage as an economic convenience, or, a kind of readily available erotic resource, may please excuse. Indeed, eros is an integral aspect of marriage, and one that we desire to explore. But, it is with all its need and vigour, all and only beauty and warmth.

5.	I believe that marriage is also between the families. I will respect my wifeÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢s family as a natural extension of my own. If you can do that too, why donÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢t we talk further!

6.	I am very religious by nature, and spend considerable time in prayer, meditation and exploring scripture. In this, I am rooted to my ownÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃâHinduÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâreligion, but also to the other great world faiths. Here I do not mean to say that I expect my wife to compulsorily prayÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâprayer is an inner calling, religion a way of life and faith a bestowal form the Absolute. But, my wife also should not have problems with my way of life.",38,Brahmin - Gour,"Delhi, Delhi, India",,Central Government,5ft 5in,delm554410,Hindu

Marriage, from an Islamic perspective, is part of a faith and it is part of the Sun'nah of the Prophet Muhammad (saw)(peace and blessings be upon him)

About me I guess, that is the reason you are here I am not perfect but I try......

I don't wear Glasses I have perfect eyesight.... those are just computer glasses in the picture

I am practicing Muslim.... Alhamduillah
I am Fortunate that I have perform hajj twice ad several umrahs...


My Name is Firoz Ibrahim, I have done my education in India and did my futher education in USA, I have completed my bachelors & work there for more then 8 years (Texas, USA)..... I am Jovial, I like to travel, Like watching Movies but not fan of Indian movies except some.... I like to listen to the new tunes but all time fav would be the Ghazals. I also Like to Watch Television & some movies.... I am excellent cook as told by my friend.... I am total foodie... But I eat only healthy..... Like to dress up well...

I doing my Masters, I was born & bought up in Bombay and US

About my Family:

We have very small family, My dad died when I was in US, He was Captain in Merchant Navy and have a small business It is handles by my Mom. One elder Sister she is married with two dotting sons one is doing his bachelors & second one is still in School. Her Husband is employed in Kuwait. Second in line is Me, then two younger brothers one is married to his college sweetheart and have very talkative daughter... youngest one he just got married....

I am family person and for me Family always comes first

I read these some where I liked it...

A Woman was made from rib of a man
She was not created from his head to top him

Nor from his feet to be step upon,
She was made from his side to be close to him
from Beneath his arm to be protected by him,
Near his heart to be loved by him........... This reflect my ideas for women......

The unit of humanity is not a man or a woman. It is a man and a woman as one, in that unison that makes them a family (just like the smallest part of water is not oxygen or hydrogen, but both united).

So if you think that you can fit in the above stuff or can u make fall in love.... then y are you still waiting...

In all 18 marketing executive works under free-lancing system in my company at various places of Andhra Pradesh, Orrisa & Karnataka. Though my company is small but produces, market exclusive quality products, growing very fast. I worked very hard to achieve these things and still working very hard to realize my dreams of taking my company to great height. 

Previously I worked as Sales executive then promoted as Area sales manager then got promotion as Regional Sales Manager in SmithKline Beecham, UK based Multi National Company from 1997 to 2002.

"Hi, I feel Self introduction is tedious job, also it is often considered as self praise. I will try to balance it here. I am handsome, simple, cool, intelligent, and down to earth and fun loving guy, like to take life as it comes. For me, life is to enjoy it fully. I am a practical person. By saying so I am also serious with respect to my career and social relationships. I like to give my best to every relationship I m in to. Talking about my activities, Well, I go to gym, do yoga & meditation everyday to keep myself physically & mentally fit, Enjoy free time with family & friends and sometimes I spend time with own self listening to Music, reading books, connecting with old pals on internet. Like to travel a lot exploring new places, beaches, mountains, sea and enjoying every bit of it. Marriage is a pious institution which stands on pillars of love, trust and respect. Also with marriage comes responsibilities and for which I have due respect. 

I want my future partner to know the fact that I had a child marriage 19years back which was broken off with mutual consent of both the parties, and If someone is narrow minded & want to only to look at this criteria for the match, please do not read further, you do not fit my criteria. Speaking about life partner, she should be well educated, with somewhat similar mindset in respect to my basic thoughts.

"Really cant understand ,how to start, where to stop & what to say.....well speaking about myself is quite a bit tough...to begin with I am not, by any means, the prince of dreams. Just a simple guy who loves the most trivial occurrences life throws at me. Life - is all about fun. I hate dull moments, but then, I can live through the toughest of them.....on one side am soft, introvert, emotional and pretty sensitive yet another side of myself reveals a pragmatic, confident, independent & responsible individual...challenge & ambition being my keywords. 

Music sends me into raptures. Sufi, hip hop, Movie Songs, bangla band.... or should I say anything. Books ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ I have enjoyed their company ever since childhood. Wrestling is another addiction (I wont fight when u have your favourite serials - promise!!!). Travelling is food for my soul (havenÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢t travelled too much really ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ so my soul is hungry for more). I don't ignore food for the stomach either. Biryani is an all-time favourite. I love mughlai food - nuns, do piaza, kebabs and more. Chinese... well... bilkul chalta hain. But then, gulping futchkas on the roadside or treating myself to a plate of chat isnÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢t less fun either. And of course, home made food - dal, posto, alubhaja, chingri, ilish and what not.

Basically am an extremely straightforward personality, unable to bear with injustice and lies...i have morals and ethics which i cling forever and one important thing I hate liars, cheaters, deception and frauds...i like truth and simplicity & i cant compromise with hypocrisy & arrogance, yet i believe in self-confidence.

Well, marriage for me is a union of one soul sharing two different bodies whose root is companionship and branches are each, love, care, trust, responsibility, and respect....it is altogether a growing process that cannot be build or arranged in a day, though I believe it goes by destiny to find ones soul-mate.

I am looking for a partner who can be my closest friend, who can just understand me to my roots and will respect me with a transparent & trustworthy attitude, who would not be afraid to show her love for me & at the same time will not hesitate to point out my drawbacks...overall she has to be a stable, loyal & a confident personality...

Seeking that elusive creature, the self-aware, aesthetically alive, intellectually alert, sensually vibrant friend with purity of smile, with care caring nature. Long drive with soft music is my passion.
