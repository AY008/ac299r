Even more fond of ruffling the feathers of established greats (as a medical student I taught my professors a thing or to about their own subjects, and as an intern I disagreed with the hospital medical superintendent on a case and turned out to be right. Recently, undermined the logic of a well-known spiritual guru and also that of a reputable medical scientist on Twitter. I'd love to travel, though I haven't yet had much of a chance. Since childhood, I've been artistically inclined. Many awards and accolades as a writer throughout my academic life, inductee into the International Poetry Hall of Fame at 16. Learned the piano early, jazz & tap dancing as a teen; opera singing for over a year before med school. While in med school I learned Kuchipudi. Have completed medical school, currently in the process of preparing for the boards, working in a hospital meanwhile. ",30,Baniya,"Los Angeles, California",,Private Sector,5ft 5in,SMF1415558,Hindu

"They would say I`m unique and diverse, cultured, average tall, cool lady Strong-physically, emotionally & mentally. I`m a GROWN woman- tricks are for kids, that`s not saying i don`t like to play or have fun I`m just not into games or game players. I`m mad passionate. i have integrity, character, values and morals. I`m perceptive, active, driven w/aspirations, intelligent w/out being conceited, articulate & objective (I have my own mind), confident w/out being arrogant, sincere, I`m romantic like a bad movie, sarcastic sometimes, honest with flaws, secure in myself, down to earth, emotionally reliable and mentally stable when i want to be. (cus everybody ain`t all there all the time-). My self confidence is healthy, but not annoying. I truly believe our bodies are our temples.... I worship mine daily. I'll make you laugh till your stomach hurts and salty water is spilling from your eyes. I hug strangers, I kiss friends, I love animals. Music nurtures my soul, and food feeds my obsession. Very few things scare me. I`m a mystery who still believes everyone can make a difference, everyone can make a change, everyone has the ability to find that place inside that makes them whole & connects them with a larger community of free thinking people who fill this world with love and effect our lives in unimaginable ways. I am also silly as hell at times, I`m an introvert and romantic, tall, intelligent, ambitious and very adventurous.

IÃ¢â¬â¢m not in to drama or people who canÃ¢â¬â¢t communicate what they want or need (I wanna talk to you not for you). Flat out lying or being fake (IÃ¢â¬â¢ll be real with you and you be real with me). I`m a laid-back lady, down with good music, working out, living good, friends, and anything fun like going out, chilling, listening to music. I'm not afraid to tell it like it is, in fact I'm afraid not to. Music gives me indescribable joy. I am a great listener (and have been known to give some solid advice), basically I like having fun and people who are into anything fun. I`m mad spontaneous & hella cautious at the same time I love being outdoors..

**********************************************************************
I did my schooling in India (CBSE), and moved to the US in 2001 to study BS in Biotechnology and graduated in June 2006.

I love traveling and have been fortunate to have visited many a destinations of the world.
This was one of the reasons for an easy transition to life in the US.

I enjoy swimming, working out, music, yoga, watching movies, socializing... I love traveling and exploring new places, going to some outdoor events, musical events, plays, etc.

I have been learning French and teach Yoga apart from working alongside my father in our family business. However, I prefer living in the US and would be moving there shortly perhaps, for pursuing an MS.

A little about being a Maharashtrian: I have always lived in Gujarat and later the US, so apart from the fact, that I do know the Marathi culture very well and I speak Marathi fluently, I have equal or more love and respect for Gujarati culture and the language, etc...

My ideal partner should be someone who has a zest for life. Someone who is confident, focussed yet funloving. I would prefer someone who wants to or is currently living either in the US or Canada.

He must be understanding, caring, loving and well settled in life. For me marriage is a big thing and before finalizing anything in this regard, we should give time to it.

"I introduce myself as a person who is simple and sober in nature as well as in thoughts and actions. My life is all about living simply and giving respect to the elders. Further, I am a true worshipper of god and never lose my faith towards him in any situation. I am very creative in nature and try to come up with innovative and unique ideas. In addition to this, I am friendly and make people comfortable with me. 
Presently I am working as a teacher in a school and I am happy with my work as it has brought a lot of respect and appreciation in my life. I am very passionate about my work and do it with full dedication and commitment.
Family plays a very important role in the development of a person. They teach us to judge good or bad things in life. They also teach us different aspects of life including valuing our relations and being loving and caring towards others.  My mother is a homemaker and father is no more. I have two sisters who are married and happy in their new world. 
Education is very eminent for an individual as it brings success in life and opens the doors of career opportunities. I have done BA from the Delhi University.
Reading books is my best way to spend my time as it takes me to another world. Further, when I am free I like to listen to my favorite music and watch movies. In addition to this, travelling is also one of my favorite hobbies. By travelling I get to know about the rich culture of different places. 
In my life very few people are close to my heart and among them are my friends. They are the only people after my family who are always there to help me and support me. Though I have very few friends but they are very important to me.

"I am a well educated Punjabi girl, working with a top Apparel Retail MNC. I have been looking for a life partner and on suggestion of a few friends I decided to use this platform to expand my partner search. 

I would like to share a few details about my educational background-
I have done my Schooling from Bal Bharti Pusa Road, and then went on to DU College to study BCom. I have done my Post graduation in Apparel management from Pearl Institute. 

Having been brought up in a close knit family of 5, I have always enjoyed a good balance on work and personal front. I love to spend time with my family over the weekend, and cook or indulge in reading. I also enjoy travelling, music, movies and catching up with friends. My friends lovingly call me the RJ of every get together as I love to chit chat and play the perfect host. I like to stay positive and value emotions, commitments and relationships of all kinds. Quite cheerful and fun loving, I believe in a broad perspective- a good mix of traditional and modern values with a real sense of responsibility in my actions. 

My expectations from a life partner are simple. I would prefer that my partner is an ambitious professional, good natured and easy going in life. I would want to grow as a person with him, blend like a daughter in his family and add joy to my life and the life of all my loved ones.",30,Arora,"Delhi, Delhi, India",,,5ft 4in,delf1349649,Hindu

"Sensitivity should not be confused with being coward. There are many people who think that people who are sensitive are timid or do not know how to be strong. I know this and I am against the notion because I am a sensitive person myself but that does not mean that I am coward. 
I have been sensitive since I was small. In a way, it was good because I donÃ¢â¬â¢t like people who act that they are strong but they are actually not. Like other people who are genuinely sensitive, I am strong by heart and can deal with tragedies if they come my way. 
I am working as a Software engineer in a company in Noida. I like my work and doing it is not irritating to me. I try to take up every opportunity that comes my way. That is how I have reached where I am now. I wish to excel in the same field in future. 
After schooling, which was very smooth, I did graduation in BCA and then post graduation in MCA from IGNOU, Delhi. I have also done B Sc from SKMU University. Currently I am pursuing MBA (IT) from PTU. 
My mother is a Teacher and my father is a retired principal from a Government School. I have two sisters. One of them is married and the other one is pursuing her Graduation. My brother has done LLB from DU and he is preparing for Civil Services. I love my family and I am very proud of them.
