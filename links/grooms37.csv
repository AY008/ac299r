Get along well with almost everyone and have a very small group of close friends. Am a foodie with a sweet tooth and love home food. I am financially very stable and believe in the concept of not only saving for tomorrow but for the day after as well.

Like any other boy, my dream too comprises of a life partner who might not come like an angel, but has a heart full of love, ready to shower its content on me, a small beautiful house where the savings treasured are love, care and sentiments that string its members together in a beautiful garland that is incomparable to even the costliest ornament in this world. I want to be that gentle breeze in the life of my partner that during its very first flow mitigates  sorrows and doubles  joy.
I always believe that foundation of a relationship should be laid on truth, so what ever I have mentioned above is true from the bottom of my heart.I am a person who loves peace,and believes that everything is done by Allah Almighty.i am a religious person.

About my marriage all i can say is that it was just not meant to be. I got married in Jan 2010 and it lasted for 8 months. Details can be provided later. It has been a very painful, emotional and a hard journey for me but we cannot stop living and Life has to go on... and I'm confident and optimistic about my future and i know that there is definitely someone there for me. I believe in Karma and destiny and at the same time believe in a higher power. I know that there are certain things in life that are beyond our control. I have left my past behind and have moved on.

"iam simple and kind hearted person, I LOVE WITH LOVE WHICH IS MORE THAN LOVE,I'm caring and sensitive with an analytical side to me.Very open minded and tend to look beyond the horizon. I tend to look at things from all angles and pull things apart in hopes of discovering. I believe no one should be closed off to the idea of broadening oneself. The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved, loved for ourselves, or rather loved in spite of ourselves. Sometimes, we believe that if everything is not perfect, we cannot be grateful for anything. We easily fall into all-or- nothing thinking. When we do this, we miss all the goodness that surrounds us. If you find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere.There is only one happiness in life, to love and to be loved. If you are out of touch with yourself, then you can not touch others.Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart. If you go out looking for friends you're going to find they're very scarce. If you go out to be a friend you'll find them everywhere. To acquire knowledge, one must study; but to acquire wisdom, one must observe. Hold fast to dreams for if dreams die, life is a broken winged bird that cannot fly. The hardest person in the world to love is the one who needs your love the most.I'm talking about fate here - when feelings are so powerful it's as if some force beyond your control is guiding you to someone who can make you happy beyond your wildest dreams.

"The prospective groom can be spoken of as a perfect gentleman, always striving to lead a righteous life; yet totally fun loving, living life to the fullest.

He is a man with strong beliefs and faith in God, upholding character, traditions and moral values and living with dignity; by God's grace far from all the vices and evil influences that penetrate thoughts, words and actions. Apart from being talked about as fun loving, his inner self is truly soft, sensitive and gentle; filled with warmth and overflowing with kindness; very polite and thoughtful; extremely caring and respectful of others; loving and joyful to the core. 

You will always find him to be a wonderful playmate to newborns, kidos and oldies alike or the best company you've ever kept or even see in him the greatest friend you've ever known. If anyone of you (again age no bar) gets lost with him or left behind on an island, no worries! You will be very well protected & cared for. Wholesome entertainment, is a bonus! He has the extraordinary ability to talk at great lengths and one wouldn't know when one topic turns into the other. The vice-versa is unbelievably true too! He can listen your heart out with absolute attention. No wonder, he too is loved and cherished by those around. He is extremely passionate and protective about all those people especially since they have added all the joy and meaning to his life.

Even as it seems that he is a people oriented person, times of solitude open up a whole different world to him. Some of his best moments in life being those spent in awe, completely absorbed in some music or a game of Cricket or Football. This apart, Dance, Theater & Photography take a prime seat too! Times thus spent, have no count on the clock, whether day or night. Nevertheless, they leave a lingering sensation on his mind. Another of his favorite indulgence is Food. While the talk of a delicious meal does bring out the ""jalebi boy"" popping up from within, a cup of tea or a meal cooked by caring hands is all he seeks to add joy to his heart. 

His leisure pursuits also involve looking out for upcoming trends in the spheres of fashion, technology & lifestyles. More often than not, he's window shopping for one of these and occasionally they do become a part of his home or personal space. At the same time, he shows a great deal of responsibility towards his finances. He's always stresses and plans on carefully managing the current resources for the betterment of the future.

His employment too is in the global financial service industry; has been working in the current USA based company for the last 8 years. Job responsibilities have also taken him half way across the globe to UK. As of now, he is comfortably settled in his home town, Pune , which he simply adores. Allow him and he will get all his family & friends to be happily settled here with all the resource support from his side!! Nevertheless, rigidity has no place in his game plan. Mindful of the pros & cons, he may be willing to relocate to other cities in India if the right opportunity knocks on his door. The same is true for a career overseas.

"Hi there! Something about myself? An oft asked question in an interview where you blink at the interviewer and reveal a good picture of you. Out here now, let me dwell a bit deeper.

Being the youngest in the family, there was always a bit of hatkeness in the way i do things. Have always had a creative bent of mind from early childhood. Sketching and painting were my favourite hobbies as a kid. Though i couldnt follow a career in the creative field, i believe destiny has got me in advertising where the only thing that works is ideas.

As a person i am free spirited, humble, innovative, humorous, have empathy, explorer, great trier, unfazed by challenges, constant learner and the list goes on. Having said all this, at the end of the day i also maintain a fine balance between tradition and modernity. A typical Metro Iyer boy. I am very passionate about sports and music. Though i do not play or perform, i take great interest in watching them either live or on TV. I believe sport builds character and music defines it. Apart from these, whenever time & opportunity comes, love to escape away from the maddening city life into the arms of nature. I am an active social person and again its split between family and friends. Not very religious, but ensure i follow the minimum required to keep my family happy.

I believe in the thought that ' the only constant in life is change. The same tried and tested bores me. Always have the keeda to try out new things in life. And lastly i also believe in live and let live as everyone has a right to live their life to the fullest. Life is indeed beautiful and theres a lot to be explored.Let me stop here as i see no end.

"'Nothing ventured, nothing gained', so here I am, actively spending my time looking for the ONE (or worst case someone) About myself: Lets see,'I THINK' I am a laid-back, witty and honest person who loves to have a laugh. Some attributes 'I THINK' I own: quite flexible (never fussy), live miles from temper and am quite caring at times. (It sounds funny describing myself but as I said I need to take some efforts to accomplish this mammoth objective of getting married!) . I enjoy making people laugh whilst having a positive outlook towards life. I have a liberal mindset and am ambitious, driven to succeed in most challenges. I often have a simplified view of world but try to wake up when faced with the harsh realities. I stand by the belief 'Work hard play even harder'. I like to take joy in simple things as I believe live is short and full of experiences, from the magnificent to the infinitesimal, from the caring to the cold, from the loving to being loved. As regards my love life! I love cooking . I love reading fiction. I love going out, making friends and doing pretty much anything social. I love playing Cricket, bar billiards, chess, et al. Don't worry I still have a lots of love remaining! As regards the important skills: I can clean the house, wash and iron the clothes, cook what you want, serve breakfast on bed, listen to gossips That's all just about me I am looking for: A kind-hearted gal with a flexible attitude.

I'd say that a verbal communication is of a great importance to me, as well as the obvious, where there has to be an equilibrium in terms of mental attraction, I suppose the acid test is upon meeting.

"I  believe in true relationships based on compatibilty and i guess one needs to be friends first. I would get married to a person with whom I can relate myself and we will be best of friends first. I value one`s independence, am (as also my parents) very liberal, and have always been independent and self-reliant. True enough, marriages are struck in heavens, I guess there is always a period of wait before one hits upon the soulmate of one`s wavelength, and for me its just the start of this road, which I will definitely want to be a short one. I find an echo of what I feel, in the lyrics of Bob Dylan:
I don't want to meet your kin, Make you spin or do you in, 
Or select you or dissect you, Or inspect you or reject you. 
All I really want to do Is, be friends with you!

Nevertheless, its marriage that I seek through this portal, and I am much serious about it. 

A voracious reader by choice, books have always given me company during lonely spells. Love to unwind on the salsa floor if favoured by the right music and partner. Have tried my fingers on the violin, sitar and golf(aweful handicap.. !!). Dont fancy the smoke or the binge, a juicy agatha christie is a better stimulator instead!
People who are beguiled by my looks and air call me intelligent! Yes, I do carry an air at times!! I ll tell you on your face if you are smelling or if your grammar sense is horrid. But dont be blown off, for I cherish compassion even towards my worst foe, if ever there was one! Besides admiring the beauty-spots, I too care for that ugly stray dog at the corner of the road.

About my family, academics and profession:
Father ex bureaucrat, and currently holding Directorship in Engineering and Financial conglomerate. Mother was a practising lawyer. I am the only child of my parents. My parents reside in Pune and I am living in Bombay by myself.
I have done my MBA Finance and this apart, I am a Bachelor of Commerce, from St. Xavier`s .
Working as an AVP in a reputed Bank, and yes, being a banker I realised that wittism and the quality to appreciate humour can soften any difficult customer.
