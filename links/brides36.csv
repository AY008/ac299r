"Hi -Searching for a very specific type of guy. My sister is a very adventurous yet kind hearted person. She has grown up in both an Eastern and Western environment and is a perfect amalgam of the two cultures. She understands the need for tradition when it is appropriate but leads a very Australian lifestyle on a day to day basis. She is highly intelligent and extremely athletic. Guys interested in her would need to appreciate these qualities. She appreciates good intelligent conversation as well as the ability to cut loose and have a wild, crazy and fun time. A good and quirky sense of humour is a definite must in any potential partner. She loves adventure sports and travelling the world and you must enjoy this as well. Rock Climbing, Snow skiing and Martial Arts are her particular fortes having reached the pinnacle in all of these but she will try most things even if just for a laugh. When not travelling the world, (she has done everything from diving with great Whites to Everest Base Camp) she is found at home cooking up a storm or baby sitting her niece and nephew who totally adore her. She enjoys the company of her numerous ecclectic friends and easily fits into any social situation or group.
Her ideal partner should be willing to share her life adventures with her and indeed introduce her to many and more fun times. Life after all is meant to be for living!He should be extremely loyal to her as she will be to him. A high ethical and moral standard is a must.

She/We do not believe in the cast system or any such social yoke so if you are into that or dates of birth or horoscopes etc then she is not the girl for you.

She is looking for an equal or better so if you are looking for a ""fair"", ""traditional girl"" with good"" homely values"" then again she is not the girl for you. She respects and ascribes to all of these naturally, but is not constrained by that mindset.

If you are looking for an attractive, athletic girl with an awesome sense of humour who loves living life to the full and extracting every moment of joy that she can, If you want an equal in life and not someone subserviant then she is certainly the type for you.

Make others laugh with me and enjoy every moment of life. Smile and the world smiles with you. Where there is a will, there is a way. When nothing goes right, when days become night. When hope becomes hopeless, when goals get dim. When the dreams you have begin to shatter. When life in front of you seems like a battle. And everything begins to rattle. When you get numb about anything that happens to you. When some try to shatter you. Hence, when nothing turns right, just remember there is always going to be a ray of light. That will guide you all the way through. So keep your patience and calm and nothing shall be harmed. Trust and believe in yourself, where there is will there is a way.
