I am a simple person having the weakness to be caring, kindhearted, down to earth, passionate, jovial on majority of occasions, which are not liked by many in this materialistic world. Sometimes, I am also workholic.

"Life is A Celebration Enjoy!!!! You Live Only Once!!
 
 I believe in the dictum - love to live, live to love. Give your best to get the best!!!All relationships blossom into loving relationships when people decide to share instead of trying to change each other. Do not expect your ideal soulmate to be someone who is always loving and easy to get along with, who agrees with everything you say or do, and who brings you a life of ease and comfort. Enthusiasm is the best protection in any situation. Wholeheartedness is contagious, so give yourself, if you wish to get others. It is your life, just imagine the possibilities!

I am looking for a partner who can celebrate the joy called 'life' with me. I want tons of laughter, loads of peace and a world of giving and sharing. Hey, hell is what we make of our lives!Heaven is how alive we can be... the sheer rapture of it!!! There is no wealth but life... it is short, but it is the sweetest joy on this planet. and one should enjoy that!! I am an extrovert outgoing, honest, sincere, sharing and caring, warm person... 

Life must be given meaning by relating to others - helping others, being helped by others, giving and taking knowledge, sympathy, fun.. all the things that make our existence worthwhile.

"Presently working as ASST. GENERAL MANAGER (MM); i.e.middle Management level, in a Steel Sector company, a Central Govt PSU. I am working in this organization for over 25yrs by now and drawing monthly salary above Rs 49000/- per month (gross) +perks. My job is non-transferable type and I live in the integrated company township well equipped with all facilities required for a decent living.

I am Hindu/Jat (Age: 48 yrs), looks much younger & energetic, with family roots in Delhi & Haryana (Gothra self - sangwan & motherÃâs -malik). I am smart, handsome with medium built & fair complexion. I am a simple living person, vegetarian, non-smoker, and teetotaler with no vice of any kind and fully devoted to the family and its welfare. I am practical, karmyogi, and down to earth person. I have enjoyed 16 yrs of marital life with no history of any family discord and blessed with two children (daughter 14 yrs & son 9 yrs). However, divorce that was sought by her  has been granted by Supreme Court of India in AugÃâ06 and case for custody of minor children presently with her and under contest, is going on in High court. I continue to lead a happy and peaceful life with the present settled job in this beautiful port city of Visakhapatnam and fully committed towards my duty and responsibility towards my children in all possible ways till they become independent and embark on some career.

I was born & all along brought-up in Delhi where my parents resided for nearly 45 years. My both sisters are married and settled abroad for over 20 yrs, i.e, in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) & Seoul (S.Korea). My both brother-in-laws are doctors and settled well in good positions in the above countries.  My only brother, elder to me, works for Delhi State Govt. and resides in New Delhi-110001 for over 25 years with his family. My Father who died 6 yrs back was an officer and retired from central govt. job and my mother is simple house-wife. She keeps visiting me but mostly stays at Delhi especially when my sisters visit India from abroad.

I thus seek, a matrimonial alliance from educated -- unmarried/widow /divorcee lady of age group 35-43yrs without any issues or physical handicap belonging to good & respected Hindu North Indian family.  To be frank, I am interested in an alliance partner who will prefer to lead a peaceful homely life with me in full dignity & honour. If someone harbors any special personal objectives or career goals in life at this middle age (except interest in a teaching job locally), it may not be possible in my place of job/stay.

"I was born in Bangalore & brought up & educated in Mumbai. Very fair, tall, handsome & looking much younger. I am simple & straight-forward in nature; sincere towards everything in life & hardworking person with a religious bent of mind, valuing customs & traditions, but with a modern, practical outlook. I am staying seperately & alone due to nuclear-family compulsions. On advice of friends & relatives, I started to search for a suitable life-partner now only afresh. Well qualified, served a nationalised & international bank for 25 years; 10 years as an OFFICER, before opting for VRS, now satisfactorily employed in the private sector. I possess own flat in Mumbai & another one in its distant suburbs. 

Basically we are South Indian Brahmins hailing originally from Thanjavur. Since there is no seperate language categorization for my mother tongue while registering the profile, I wanted to mention mother tongue in this manner: ' Kannada / Tamil.' I have entered Kannada as my mother tongue since only one language can be mentioned; but some language has to be mentioned. I could have equally entered Tamil too as my mother tongue. There is no arrangement to mention both Kannada & Tamil as my mother tongue. We factually speak Thanjavur Marathi at home, which is different from the usual Marathi spoken in Maharashtra. But having been brought up in Mumbai since birth, I have studied the regional language Marathi & know to read & speak. Thanjavur Marathi is a mixture of Sanskrit, Old Marathi, Kannada & Tamil words. Hence I know both the languages Kannada & Tamil & can understand little Malayalam & Telugu as well. People from our community are miniscule in number. It is common in our community to make matrimonial alliances with Kannada & Tamil (Iyer / Iyengar) speaking Brahmins, & Kannada / Tamil (Iyer / Iyengar) speaking Brahmins also do not hesitate to give their sons or daughters in marriage with our community, so much so that some of our relatives are speaking Kannada / Tamil at home as their mother tongue because we share a common religion, culture, tradition, customs & practices as South Indian Brahmins with regard to celebration of festivals or conducting thread ceremony or marriage ceremony etc.
 
My hobbies include reading books, magazines & newspapers, listening to Carnatic Classical Vocal as well as Carnatic music & also other kinds of songs and music in different regional languages including Hindi, English, learning languages, visiting places of tourist & religious interest, yoga, pranayama & meditation etc. I have completed several Yoga & Pranayama Courses. I love small chidren, nature, flora & fauna. I am also a Shri Krishna [Gaudia Mutt & ISKCON], Swamy Ayyappan, Shirdi Sai Baba, Satya Sai Baba & Avadhoot Baba Shivanand devotee, presently attending their respective satsangs, but willing to change as per circumstances after marriage. I have also done The Art Of Living Course & attending Veda & Swami Chinmayananda Study Group Vedanta Classes in spare time. As judged by others, I am a person of clean habits, having no vices & encumbrances at all.
 
In short, Responsible, Respectful, Caring & Sharing, Loving, Family oriented person. Love to travel. Hailing from a good family background. I only aspire for mutual love, affection, caring & to settle down once again with peace & happiness in life.

I have learnt Hindustani Classical Music till Madhyama II year (Hawain Guitar) from Gandharva Mahavidhyala, Delhi and capable of playing various kinds of musical Instruments. I take private Tutions for Guitar, Keyboard etc. I am also associated with an Orchestra group. Academically I could not excel much on account of certain unavoidable situations and circumstances, which prevailed in the family due to various factors and reasons. (Details will telll you later). Unfortunately during such juncture, it was only my studies that were mostly affected, in comparison to my siblings; as such the impact of the losses & damages caused with respect to my studies initially, continued and affected in my further education as well. Thus, I could not pursue my studies after matriculation. Moreover due to existence of economical uncertainty in the family because of father being jobless, I along with other siblings had to take up different jobs at an early and had to support the family to minimize the financial crisis that had been prevailing during those difficult and unforgettable days. Thereafter gradually things got improved & stabilized and one after the other all my brother and sisters got married except myself. Currently I am working as Asstt.

He had spent and devoted most of his time on social and other similar activities rather then giving priority and first preference to discharge his duties & responsibilities towards his own family. Mother is a housewife and she is the backbone of our family. Both are staying with me.

My ideal match would be someone who is kind and considerate, generous and thoughtful, easy-going and funny. Someone who is not chained to their job, their computer or cell phone would be a plus. Nothing wrong with being a go-getter, but there has to be a good balance, don't you think? Someone who is mature, responsible and intelligent. Someone who puts butterflies in my stomach. Someone who effortlessly makes me laugh. Someone who isn't afraid to make a decision if needed. It would be nice to find a relationship where each person's personality and attitude compliments the other. I also think building upon a relationship first is the way to go.

"Marriage happens only once. That is what I personally believe in. When both the players have deep respect for the marriage institute, play the game with fare intention; solemnly follow set of rules without looking beyond each other. When you learn to live harmoniously with your better half, you grow, mingle and dissolve together evolving into a homogeneous entity forming a perfect concoction  called ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃËsoulmatesÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢. My late wife was a charismatic, beautiful, sensible and an intelligent lady whom I searched in the crowd after a great toil. But a personal tragedy took her away in the prime of her life.
Life has to go on and it is only one life you are endowed with of which you are conscious of. The concept of HOME is incomplete without a woman and I believe that a woman is an axis around which the entire house revolves and the lives of its occupants are woven. 

On a positive note, a second chance make you more sensitive towards life and one really learns that all those small and seemingly insignificant moments of life which passed unnoticed/overlooked were of tremendous importance when one pauses, stands and stares and absorbs them with a lovely smile. Your whole perspective of life gets a complete overhaul. 

Relationships are always to be worked out and need time to mature.

Self Assessment:

Describing me myself is not that important. When it comes to describe oneself it is a tremendous task. One can choose so many catchy adjectives for self description. But all the words are likely to loose their meaning and sheen when you view them with your own perspective. How can I be self judgmental?

I am a typical Scorpio and thanks to Linda GoodmanÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢s Star Signs for elaborately describing my personal traits and deep routed secrets. A straight-forward and forthright person, I am physically pleasant, mentally strong, emotionally delicate (idiot) and spiritually evolved. 

I have a romantic passion for everything that I undertake. Deeply interested in all Fine Art fields. I occasionally write poems and delve in paintings. Music uplifts my soul and gives fluidity to my emotions.

I like reading literature; preferably Classics. That is a gift my wife gave to me. Thomas Hardy is my favorite.

I love photography and am an ardent reader of Indian history which inspires me for embarking upon journeys to off track places. 

I am deeply in love with the Himalayas and perfectly tuned with nature. Cooking is a sort of meditation for me. Keeping my home spick & span is my pastime.

My energy level being high, I always keep myself indulged in some or the other creative activity and can not sit still.

I have been practicing Yoga for the past 30 years. I love to go for trekking and undertake walks for miles.

I have no any ambition; I am not in race for money and am fully contended. I am thankful to the God for whatever He has given to me. I am not a kind of person who keeps on going to temples for fulfillment of his desires since I have almost none.
