"As-salam Alaikum, I am originally from Kolkata. I am the eldest child of my parents. I am extremely family oriented, God fearing, loving, caring, honest, devoted and culturally quite sound. Though I do not offer five times Salat (Namaz) due to lack of time but religiously I am quite sound. I am quite hardworking and manage my finances quite well. Apart from working in the Bank I occasionally conduct school and college events as a Quiz master and Emcee. I had started my career as a school teacher years ago. My first marriage was to a Hindu girl which lasted for one year ten months. The religious, social and cultural differences between us and her unjustifiable demands to break all contacts with my family and her continuous rejection towards my family and religion was the primary reason why we got divorced. Now I am looking forward to make a new start with a partner who is educated, religiously sound, loving, caring and genuinely accepts my family and shows love and respect for all.

"Pretty easy going, very open minded and laid back at times. Friends describe me as gentle by nature and down to earth person. I am far from being perfect but I think I am very honest and sincere. On a cautionary note, I have a bit calm and quiet personality and also take little bit time to open up. On the positive side, I am a good listener, well read and usually aware of what is going around in the world. And yes, I do know how to respect women. I recently moved back to Mumbai from US in March after about 5 years in US. It wasn't an easy decision leaving the life of comfort, decent salary, green card and of course a great city. But I think it as a professionally better opportunity. I bought a flat in Mumbai few years back (My parents currently stay with me but they have their house nearby). I like traveling, good music, dancing, movies, shopping, gymming (6/7 hrs a week), occasional cooking (veggie Indian/Chinese), museums, economics, stock markets, intellectual conversations etc. Fav. hobby is weight training (I might not look that beefy but can bench 200+ lbs). Normally I love hanging out with friends on weekends or evenings but still trying to adjust to Mumbai life. (I dont have a big friend circle in Mumbai since I moved back. Also going to take driving classes. We have a car but I am not used to driving in India. I don't have any expectations as such. I like sweet girl, prefer someone who is compassionate and caring. No big ego or attitude. I also think being madly in love with someone is really cool. Looking for an open minded, liberal thinking, educated, easy going, loving, caring, friendly and a sweet girl. Don't believe in caste system and horoscope (no issues if you need horoscope matching though) Don't really care about anything other than compatibility (You can't judge a person by their language, religion, country, family etc).

I am a game engineer - graduated from Carnegie Mellon and - working with a small creative (video) game studio, based out of Pittsburgh. 

I am generally very patient with people and I like to surround myself with friends. 

I like listening to good music on high volume & going on long drives with car windows down. I can't help playing with dogs when I see them on the streets. I like dipping my feet in water - and wow - that's a perfect end to an awesome day. 

I can't sing or dance in public; I don't like pronouncing words that I haven't heard before; and I am incapacitated when it comes to gardening, basketball or balancing my accounts. 

Making pencil sketches, running marathons and playing soccer are some of the things I fantasize about being good at. Slipping into dreams is a nice segway into the future. Someday I want to open both - a cafe/restaurant of my own and a game studio of my own. 

My work involves making & playing fun games and am very passionate about it. I love my work and am a self-confessed workaholic. 

I believe that two people who are together need to cherish their relationship with as much passion. The relationship and the people stop growing otherwise. I believe that the two people share equal responsibility in this blissful journey - whether its about doing dishes or repaying mortgages. I also believe that the relationship is driven by mutual love & respect. ",31,Kayastha,"Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India",,Private Sector,5ft 10in,ahem1035552,Hindu

"I'm a happy go lucky person. I like to meet people, I don't open up so early though. Once I trust someone, I'm an open book to them. I like riding bike, hanging out with friends, listening to music. I don't generally lose my temper but don't calm down soon if I do. I am in a way possessive, about my parents, friends and every near and dear one. I look for the last word in a conversation or argument. I honour my family values and traditions and would like such a partner who would have respect for them as well. I like being in group, I enjoy being alone though. I am stubborn and don't generally accept changes unless it's benefits are clear to me. I may not be smart but pretty good at what I do. I believe that everything happens with God's wish nothing is hidden from him. Having faith in him is my virtue. 'You will reap as you sow' is my principle and I strictly follow it. I like hanging out with friends, going for movies, outings, etc. I don't like shopping much. Shopping for me is just going and getting what I want. I really can't bargain, rather don't want to bargain. I don't look for brands but I may buy branded things if I like them. I don't hesitate spending for the things I like. I don't like to show or express sorrows because I believe that life already has many sorrows, why increase them showing mine. If I'm not at work, I'd rather be at home surfing on the internet or with my friends or riding my bike what makes me angry is things not going my way, lies and most of all betrayal. I can take anything but backstabbing. I feel that marriage is bringing together of two people their values not to forget their families and binding them for life. I am in search of a partner who should understand me, my values, be with me during all the moments in life, good or bad, who can accept me as I am and the one I may contend my life for.

Apart from my work, I like to dabble in investing, mostly equity-based and I'm planning to learn and gradually enter other asset classes. I'm also strongly ambitious and aspire to start my own venture someday.

At a personal level there are many different aspects of myself that I doubt I'll be able to fit into this box. I love travelling and going places. With my travel bug, comes my fascination for nature and my love for painting and photography. I mostly paint landscapes in an attempt to recreate the beauty that I see in the world outside. 

I'm an avid reader but it's been a long time since I've read any fiction. I generally read biographies and non-fiction. I find it very inspiring to read about the achievements of people who have left their mark on the world in some way. I also write from time to time depending on what inspires me when. I'm a student of Vedanta and I spend time regularly on reading related texts.

I believe in fitness, so you are likely to see me working out in the gym or on the treadmill in the evenings. However on warm summer days, I'm more likely to be in the pool than anywhere else.

When it comes to music, I'm a fan of varied kinds of music, from rap, hip-hop and rock to ghazals (esp. Mirza Ghalib) and Indian classical music. 

My father is working as a Director in an software MNC head quartered at San Francisco. My mother is a house wife and I have a brother who is currently studying Engineering.

We belong to an established family with our ancestral home near Sambalpur in Orissa, where my grand parents live.

He is a friendly, fun loving and jovial person and enjoys the company of like-minded people. Travelling, exploring new places and beauty of nature is one of his passions.

He carries a calm, composed and steady head on his shoulders and very rarely loses his composure and temper.

He is very health conscious and loves his gym sessions. He is extremely down to earth, very well balanced, loves healthy humour, thinks analytically with a sense of empathy. Can get along pretty well with 'The Crankiest Creature' provided he/she has a 'Grace' in him/her. Being a LEO he is very adventurous, stylish and love best of new things.

"Bismillah.Assalaam Alaikum.

I describe myself as organized, loyal, decent, amiable, stable and compassionate with a very attractive personality. I identify with and appreciate the values of Islam but consider myself spiritual more than religious. Being born at Purulia, West Bengal, I did my schooling from the most reputed school in West Bengal. I have completed my graduation from Burdwan University and I have completed my MBA from IIM Bangalore. I've also completed my PGDBM from Delhi University.
I am also very much smart, handsome, dashing, strong, positive minded, goal oriented person. I try to achieve the best in my work. I set quite a very high standard for myself to achieve distinction in anything that I do.

All i want to say is Allah himself is very beautiful n has created everything beautiful so none of his creation is useless,I m sincere n honest,I like to help others n alwayz respect elders,I alwayz speak the truth n same expect from others.Habits r the reflection of our parents n i m proud of my parents,I alwayz adopt Good Habits.My family is settled in Jamshedpur,jharkhand but we are basically from Puruliya,West Bengal.

I think human beings are too dynamic and multi dimensional to be sketched in a few words here. I am a transparent person, and usually my face tells all. Pretty broad-minded, I speak my mind and hate misunderstandings. Maybe that's why I give communication so much importance and always give the other person a chance to explain himself/ herself first. I am thirsty for knowledge and love to know and do new things, even if they scare me in the beginning.Love traveling but haven't travelled much yet. My religion is very important to me (its so logical and practical)! The ultimate knowledge I am an extrovert and an incurable romantic. I am real naughty and headstrong so you better be able to handle me Treat me like an equal and I will treat you like a Queen.

I am a humorous, down-to-earth philosophical  and independent guy who loves to read, travel, trek, bike and quiz.  I work for Ashok Leyland in Chennai, in a job that lets me make the most of my twin passions, automobiles and marketing. Life has been interesting. I was born in Mumbai, shifted base to Kerala where I endured high school and Mechanical Engineering, and then to Goa where I did my MBA from GIM. Got a job in AL and spent the next ten months on a project in Indore.  Moved to Chennai in 2008, and have been here ever since.  I spend my time reading, biking, trekking and since May, learning Kalaripayattu.  
Ideal Match
IÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢ÃâÃÂ¢m compatible with most people. But IÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢ÃâÃÂ¢m happiest in the company of intelligent book-loving philosophical travel bugs who see the humorous side of life. My closest friends love me for my jokes (mostly PJs), my books, discussions (sometimes philosophical) on every topic under the sun, free advice on automobiles and my shoulder they can lean on when things are less than brightest. 
My ideal match is someone who is a blend of all these. Someone who wants to live the journey called life to the fullest. A person who is independent, sensible, down-to-earth, and thinks for herself. Someone who seeks a partner, a soulmate, and most importantly, a friend to share this journey.  
Family 
My parents are cool, down to earth folks. They were in Mumbai for a long time (my sister and I were born there) till we settled down in Palakkad in ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢ÃâÃÂ¢95. Though both of them are originally from Palakkad, my father grew up in Kerala and spent his working life in Mumbai, while my mother was raised there and worked there.  My dad retired from government service recently, and mom is a teacher.  My younger sister is studying in Mumbai. Ours is a home where we speak four languages, eat mixed cuisines, read a lot and laugh a lot more.  Any contribution to the languages, cuisines and general mayhem are most welcome.
