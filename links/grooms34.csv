I am more of an introvert, but I have a few close friends with whom I am quite open and confide in, share my problems and weaknesses. Most times I am rational, but sometimes I am emotionally driven. People as they slowly get acquainted with me realize that, even though I am scholarly, I mostly stay down to earth, and am humble and surprisingly a fun loving person. Most of my colleagues think of me as a humorous guy to be around with, because I have something or the other going on with my facial expressions, exaggerated narratives, pranks and practical jokes.

I do have strong opinions in certain areas but they are more of political and social interests, otherwise I am very flexible where I need to be and stubborn where its required, which I attribute to being a Capricornian trait. 

I love reading science, mathematics and technical stuff as they really keep me hooked on.

A brief about my brother ( in his own words)

Currently working for CBC Group LLC as Senior Financial Analyst. Company is based of Dallas, TX and provides due diligence services for collateral examination. 

In my free time I try to catch up with some fun (movies, TV, bowling, cricket, hitting gym, Tennis and cooking). I am also a practicing Buddhist which I follow alongside my Hinduism prayers. I wonÃât say I am too religious but lately have started understanding the importance of God. Not very deep into philosophy but ÃâTo believe is God, rest is a mythÃâ. Practical outside and emotional inside, so things do matter when they are supposed to.
Living in US is both exciting and dull, the way you want to see it. People like to interact and are accommodating too when you approach them. I am a vegetarian and have survived in good shape so far.Though I am a vegetarian by choice, I do not mind by better half enjoying the other style of food. Plenty of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options around. . I like to eat outside but not alone. So usually cook for myself over the weekend. My cooking ranges from couple of India dishes (basic paneer and dal ones) to Italian and Chinese . 

I have my own house in Dallas and I earn enough to lead a decent life here.

"Hello. I am Debashish Mitra. I am a very caring, fun loving, liberal, simple minded, gentle and cheerful person with multiple interests and activities. I love computers, sports, nature, animals, driving, fast cars, adventure, travelling, music (western and Indian classical, devotional, heavy metal), photography, health and nutrition, fragrances and am refined in my principles and tastes. By profession I am a senior software engineer (in IT for more than seven years at the time of writing) working in the world's largest IT company. I love to travel and have spent a considerable amount of time in USA and Europe for my assignments. I love Europe for its history and romanticism and love USA for its natural beauty, professionalism, respect and tolerance for all individuals, cultures and nationalities and freedom and support for innovation and creativity. I have a very modern outlook, have a taste for the finer things in life, have a strong religious inclination, am broad minded and am adjustable to various situations. My friends say that I have a very competitive streak - it is true that I love to win in all walks of life and excel in everything I do but at the same time I am extremely sensitive towards others' feelings and sensitivities and I take utmost care to make sure that people are comfortable around me. I am a good listener and believe in giving people more than their due respect. I believe I have a mind broad enough to respect human individualities. Qualities that attract me are affection, care, compassion, a broad mind, serenity, depth of knowledge, gracefulness, eloquence and cheerfulness. Though I can (and always consciously try to) make people feel comfortable in my presence, I observe care in choosing my friends. I have high regards for elders and seniors and am not really appreciative of disrespectful, insensitive people. I am very passionate about justice in general. We were brought up lovingly in a way that taught me to respect all kinds of philosophies, ideologies, cultures and opinions. I am a teetotaler. My friends describe me as: smart, witty, fun loving, caring, respectful, competitive, dignified, sophisticated and humble. I am looking for a sweet, caring and compassionate girl who can reciprocate the ample trust, care and companionship that I will provide, be my best friend and be with me through the thick and thin of life. For me total trust, deep love, emotional attachment and companionship are most important because that is what I will provide myself. And it will be great if apart from these, she is fun loving, loves nature, pets and animals and has a taste for the finer things in life.

"Hi, Thanks for taking time to visit my profile. I am trying a rather difficult thingÃ¢â¬Â¦explaining myself and a little something about my partner preference.

About Me, I am a down to earth person, with minimal hang-ups in life. Am a straight forward on the face person, donÃ¢â¬â¢t believe in keeping things for later, rather just get it over with in that moment. My idea is be truthful and transparent to the people who matter the most in your life, never lie, and I really am put off when people who matter to me most lie. I lead a life where work and pleasure go hand in hand. I love adventure sports, love to go for treks, and am a techno junkie. I cannot imagine my life without gadgets.

Before marriage, I would really like to get to know the girl better. I would like to know her likes and dislikes, her interests, ambitions, dreamsÃ¢â¬Â¦ so before we enter a bond, we have actually understood each other which as per me is a very important aspect in the matrimonial process.

Respect is an inherent quality which cannot be inculcated, it just shows up. I respect people and admire independent women who have their own ambitions and goals in life. I would really support my wife in all her endeavorsÃ¢â¬â¢, and I hope sheÃ¢â¬â¢d support me in mine, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s how a good relationship progresses, isnÃ¢â¬â¢t it?
I know two people canÃ¢â¬â¢t always be on the same page, but I am a pretty balanced, chilled out person in that regardÃ¢â¬Â¦ I respect the opinions of others and IÃ¢â¬â¢d expect the same from her.

A good relationship starts with a good companionship which I would like to carry on after marriage...where we can share our highs and lows together and be there for each other in our good times and badÃ¢â¬Â¦I know it takes a lot to be committed and I donÃ¢â¬â¢t want to marry just because of parental pressure or because itÃ¢â¬â¢s the right ageÃ¢â¬Â¦I want to marry someone who I can share all the special moments in life with, someone who IÃ¢â¬â¢d love to grow old withÃ¢â¬Â¦someone who I would love getting up next to every morning for the rest of my life.

I donÃ¢â¬â¢t claim to be out & out romantic person... but am fairly romantic in my own waysÃ¢â¬Â¦ Romance is a nebulous thing with the curious property of being describable but not definable. I feel romance is an essential and integral part of any relationship to keep it lively and full of fun...

I am into IT, working with one of the top MNCÃ¢â¬â¢s in Mumbai as a Lead Sr. Consultant into IT Infrastructure management.

I am Kaustubh, 29yr old engineer. I am second generation entreprenuer. I run my own advertising agency. Although i did my graduation in Electrical engineering, i always wanted to have a career in mass communication, so after 3yrs in this industry i am comfortably placed and confident about pursuing this line and making my agency best in the business. 
I recently directed my first short film (art) which premiered at the 'Festival De Cannes' at the Short Film Centre. Other than that, my ad film (on AIDS Awareness) won me the OOBY Award. I love exploring any and all avenues related to creativity. 
Apart from advertising and media i have also started my own Foundry engineering consultancy company that deals in specialized software soultions for foundry business and represents a few foreign companies in India. 

Other than work i love reading, writting and music. Music is my soul, what i love to listen depends on my mood. I also love watching movies and travelling. 
I am a good conversationist, have a positive attitude towards life, self made and ambitious.

Over this he had this strong sense of curiosity and looking above what met the eye. He has always valued tradition and embraced the contemporary. And he has had a deep appreciation for art. All of these have today translated into a smart, adventurous and exciting person who has really big dreams in life.

"FAMILY BACKGROUND
Our ancestors had Zamindari in Harinavi, now a town situated in the District of South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, forming a part of Greater Kolkata. 
Our 22nd Ancestor came and settled in the then Town of Calcutta in Thanthania (now College Street), from Harinavi in the middle of 1700s, where he built a house. 
After his death various financial constraints arose and consequently our Zamindari passed out of our hands and our ancestral house also had to be sold, in the year circa 1839. 
The Great Grandson of 22nd ancestor, our direct lineal ascendant, was a Vakil (equivalent to a present day Advocate) and practiced law in the Suddar Diwani Adalat (equivalent to a present day High Court) in the Presidency Town of Calcutta, when he earned many fames and laurels in the field. He purchased a house Jhamapukur, in the year circa 1874 (now Shankar Ghosh Lane); which is our present residence.
 My son is the fifth generation lawyer in our family.

Spare time, I read a lot mostly related current affairs, history, business and auto/biographies (hardly any fiction though) Weekends is mostly out trekking, sports, with friends and if it rains, then at home watching a movie. Intend to expand to learn some arts, some community work, etc.

Hi, my name is Amit. I am an Indian, cast-Baniya,slim and fair and have my own business. I am looking for the perfect life partner. I would like to marry a simple, loving girl. She should from the same caste. ",34,Baniya,"Purnia, Bihar, India",,,5ft 7in,purm1374185,Hindu
"Hi, I am a frivolous but at the same time emotional and introvert type of guy. Family values are of utmost importance to me. Am looking for that perfect loving partner who understand me and and can coagulate together with my family. Really don't know am good or bad, but that's a way i am. I hate hypocrites and liars. I my view, a relationship based on fictitious and untrue facts cannot stand anywhere. 

On a professional front, am a bit ambitious who always want to grow up in the ladder of hierarchy. Am a graduate from DU, PGDM (MBA) in finance, Master in Business Economics (last sem) and currently pursuing my CFP (Certified Financial Planner) from FSPB affiliated with United States. Currently, am serving a leading Indo-Japanese joint venture company dealing in investment/corporate advisory as Asst. Manager. 

I believe, life is a onetime affair and one should see all the aspect of it. For me, a definition of any perfect and successful life includes 

""a perfect life partner bonded with love and understanding, a perfect and united family embraced with values and love for each other. A good professional career which should provide enough esteem and financial growth for our present and future but above all, enough time and personal moments of love and fun with the life partner which can be cherished and remembered for ever"" 

If your definition of life somewhat relates to above, then you could be that perfect partner. Don't hesitate to directly get in touch through telephone All the very best for your searches. May everyone gets their suitable partners.

I am a Puneite and completed entire education over here. Achieved good grades right from my school till post-graduation. Have won many awards in elocution competitions at graduate/postgraduate level, Technical Paper/Proposal submission at corporate level. 

My family and a few close friends have been solid support and mentors in my life and are definitely as much responsible in shaping my thinking and personality as much as my experiences over the years have been.

Personally, I believe I am a confident, creative and passionate person who's a fashion victim at times and believes in retail therapy, friend to many, soul mate to a few, a firm head on shoulders, well grounded, adventurous, optimistic, outgoing, driven person with a modern yet traditional outlook to life. I am more spiritual than religious in my beliefs in the superior being. I like meeting smart motivated people who see the bigger picture in life. 

While most of my waking hours are spent at work, during weekends I cherish quality time with family and friends, sight seeing, watching movies and more. I come across as a health freak (as my friends call me) - whenever time finds me, I like to hit the gym or exercise at home. But frankly, is a big foodie at heart. I love to try out new dishes and find out the ingredients used. I have a passion for Car driving and owe a fabulous Hatchback Car. Like to be self-dependent in whatever I do (Have a self owned house). I come across a very passionate person when it comes to relationships, my work, theatre and especially filmmaking.

"Hello and welcome to my profile. I've finally come to that juncture in my life, where I am in search of that special girl, who will make it complete in every possible way - or in short i'm &quot;in pursuit of happyness&quot;.

The following lines are an attempt at describing myself in so many words as to help you make a decision on whether it is I; with whom you would like to spend the rest of your life - a daunting question, nonetheless, surely the first step towards the answer.

So to start with, I belong to a nuclear Bengali Kayastha Family and am the elder sibling of the two brothers; (details of my family can be found in the following sections). I'm a computer engineer by education, work for the BPO subsidiary of IBM in India and am based in the NCR (Norther Capital Region, which includes Delhi, Gurgaon, NOIDA and Faridabad). About my job - I'm part of the corporate group within the organization and work as a Client Solutions Manager, designing business outsourcing solutions for international clients and presently manage business opportunities for the European geography.

Personally, i'm a simple person with a very positive attitude towards life.The smallest of good things are enough to give me the boost of positive energy that I always thrive on and I have a taste for the finest of things, in whatever I strive for. I'm a very romantic person at heart and a very firm believer in the institution of marriage. I love good cuisine and personally admire people who have a good hand at cooking. And very rightly said I should say, that the way to a mans heart is through his stomach.

On the creative side there's an ameature photographer in me, which helps me unwind and at times brings out bouts of creativity, which I'm made to believe can sell well. Although I've never gone that route,nonetheless the idea keeps intriguing me from time to time and in the near future I do plan on selling some of my work. I also love to travel. I love long drives and am a person who believes in seeing interesting places in the world with my own eyes and lenses (my camera).

As far as your expectation from me is concerned, you can rest assured that in me you shall find a partner who will share your dreams, enjoy your happiness, stand by you in testing times and will be your best friend for a lifetime...

In the following lines, I've tried to list down my thoughts of the attributes, I think that special girl in my life should possess. It wasn't so easy, but I've tried to focus on the fundamentals rather than on anything superficial, to make things easier:
She should be a firm believer in the institution of marraige
She should be tall, presentable and should have a disposition that can bring a smile to anyone's face
Preference is for her to be atleast 5 feet 5inches tall or more, for us to look good as a couple
She should be simple, however should be well educated, mature and Smart
She needs to be able to relish an identical flavor for both traditional and modern value systems

My parents have firm faith in astrology and insist on our horoscopes being matched prior to proceeding.

Following are my astrological details which shall help you have my horoscope matched with yours:

Date of Birth: 27th August, 1979
Time of Birth: 10:20 PM
Place of Birth: Calcutta, India
Gon: Debari Gon

I will need the same information from you so that we can have the needfull done at our end. Going by astrological preferences, The prospective bride should be of Deb gon or Debari Gon.

We insist you to kindly contact only with the prospective bride's photographs. For profiles without photographs, please send those directly at my father's email address, which shall be provided once we start communicating.

Thank you once again for the patience to go through my profile. In case you feel you would like to proceed, please send me an interest and I shall get my parents to speak with you / your parents and we shall take it from there.",34,Kayastha,"Delhi, Delhi, India",,Private Sector,6ft 1in,d_ray,Hindu

"As-salamuaalyekum : lets begins with salam :



I am happy go lucky kind of a person who luvs to meet new people & understand them from deep within the heart.I always luv to keep a pleasing smile on my face & make others face also lit with a pleasant smile.........


I, me, myself...
I think I'm a pretty easy-going person. I'm quite honest, straight-forward and sincere.
I am not fussy about things and really don't bother about material acquisitions!



My attitudes and core beliefs...

I appreciate honesty and transparency in relationships and feel that ready-made compatibility is a myth. If two people wana be together, they work things out for themselves.
One thing which, I feel, is imperative to a strong relationship is- appreciation for your partner. People must genuinely acknowledge and appreciate each other's efforts to keep the relationship strong and lasting.


My leisure-time activities...
I love chatting with my family over a cup of tea or watching the Reality shows with them. I love going shopping with my friends on weekends and enjoy spicey foods like kabab's chicken tandoori.
If I feel like lazing, I power on my pc & begins to chat. On a bright sunny day, I love to play cricket with my friendz and on a beautiful rainy day, I love sitting at my window, listening to music, enjoying the natural beauty.


What makes me laugh...
Hmm... That's a tough one to answer. Well anything silly or hillarious or a joke on our darling 'Serdies' or just a Tom & Jerry movie!


What makes me cry...
My mum watching a stupid 'Saas-Bahu' serial and simultaneously criticising the crazy (read 'ridiculous') storyline. That really makes me feel like howling .


What are the things that bug me...
Gossiping housewives.
Dumb and dull actresses ( Aishwarya Rai).
Cheap Bollywood movies (those cheap sitcoms or ridiculous romantic movies).
Exorbitant prices.
Flashy people.
Disgustingly dark and dingy discotheques.
The list is quite exhaustive actually!


My behaviour...
At work, I'm a complete workaholic. I love my job and I really enjoy doing what I'm doing now. I think I'm a perfectionist when it comes to work.
At home, i'm a complete family person. I enjoy the company of my family and friends and wouldn't hesitate going out of the way to extend them a helping hand.



My partner:
I strongly believe in the saying-'beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder'
Her eyes should speak before she speaks with words .
I think i have a natural inclination for sauve and cultured people.
My partner must be chivalrous, well-educated . I wana marry a woman who I can look up to.
A woman who is merciful and respects the values of Islam. A person who is kind and compassionate.

Thank You for spending ur time on reading my profile and wish u all the luck for your partner search. 

Note : I ask forgiveness if I end up hurting anyone in the process of selection... I am human and moreover I want to marry only once. Please don't hold it against me if I am meant for someone else. May all of us succeed in finding our right partners... Ameen! Secondly, forgive me if my reply is absent or delayed. I have to be selective, do understand. 
May Allah Bless You

Take Care,

"Louis K. Anspacher said, Ã¢â¬ÅMarriage is that relation between man and woman in which the independence is equal, the dependence mutual, and the obligation reciprocalÃ¢â¬?. 

I do believe in these lines said by Louis K. Anspacher.  A marriage is a relation where we respect each otherÃ¢â¬â¢s individual identity.  Mutual trust and understanding life partners are those foundations on which the superstructure of marriage is built. And yes, I cannot miss out on honesty, it is as important as breathing. These are my beliefs and expectations from my partner.

My life rotates around my family, for me itÃ¢â¬â¢s the axis on which my world spins. I am always in the pursuit of giving ample time and happiness to my family and that is what enables me to maintain a rhythm in the professional career and family affairs. Being able to spend quality time at home with elders and children is very imperative to me and for me ambition and family orientation is correlated. 

Ambition is that catalyst which always ignites you to achieve whatever you have desired. My ambition is to gain stability and growth in the chosen career to keep my family financially healthy.  

I am not away from the words of Aristotle who once said that man is a social animal. Instead of getting more social I love to share my time only with selected friends.   I do justice with myself by means of listening music, swimming, watching sports and travelling. 

Determination and persistence resides in me and these two are the guiding principles which spur me in to achieve what I wish.  I believe that, Ã¢â¬Åwhere there is will, there is a wayÃ¢â¬?.  ",34,Marwari,"Raigarh, Chhattisgarh, India",,Private Sector,5ft 5in,raim1278520,Hindu

"Well its better to stick to the site and be serious because common I hope people are serious about gettin married and not just spending their leisure time browsing thru this site. Anyways without delaying any further i'll straight away jump to my personality and partner expectations. 

First and foremost thank you for removing your precious time and reading my profile. I am down to earth, very extrovert and take life as a challenge and always carry a positive attititude. Nothing puts me off unless it becomes too annoying for me. In my leisure time i like to watch movies or read a book or listen to music and ya i love to cook. 

Im a moderate kind of a person so i would love to hang out with friends or on other occasions i would just like to be home. My friends consider me friendly and hold a good sense of humour. 

My favourite tv channels are Discovery, National Geographic, Channel V, ESPN, HBO, Movie channels, BBC News. 

According to me relationships are the best thing that can ever happen to anybody and marriage is like an ultimate goal to be achieved. I firmly believe that marriage is not just husband or wife, its more like being two best friends and working as a team to achieve their goals. I definitely want to consider my wife as my partner where we can deal with anything and everything. By the way I am not a male chauvinist, i believe in doing things equally with my partner. 

I want to consider my relationship with my wife as a friend where we both can share anything and everything. Im looking for a girl who is down to earth, caring, loving and of all love my family. Also, I want a loyal and trustworthy relationship with my wife so girls please if you are a hypocrate then please dont bother to contact me. I will surely go out of my way to respect my partners family and make sure they treat me like their son. I am definitely looking for some serious relationship here, hope i find the girl i've been waiting for. 
Goodluck to all members.

I am a sociable person who enjoys the company of good friends and like to live life to the fullest in each new moment. With a positive outlook and a spiritual strength, I believe in taking on the challenges of life. I believe in living each moment as a learning experience and as a source of mental nourishment.
I believe that life is not to be experienced in bits and pieces but rather in the holistic vision of experience and capabilities. In keeping with this spirit I wish to devote my life towards achieving a fruitful synthesis of the world of science and arts in order to arrive at a creative equilibrium.
In a life partner one expects to find a person who can share every moment and every thought with the same impulse as one's own. I expect an individual sensibility, a sense of aestheticism and harmony that can make someone a partner in my life in the true sense of the word. I wish to marry a person who impulsively finds a sense of compatibility with me and adds to my inspiration.",34,Ramgariah,Others,,Private Sector,5ft 8in,bobbysinghm11,Sikh

"Hi, I am putting up this profile on behalf of my son. He has done his Masters. Till recently he was working at Delhi and went to Bangalore for further studies. However, since my own business of providing engineering services in cement and steel making industries has been expanding myself and my wife took a decision of asking our son to join in the family business at Asansol. My son has done his schooling in an English medium school and is an MCA from IGNOU. He is my only son and his only younger sister is married. She is a Post Graduate from TISS Mumbai and is presently working at New Delhi as a Senior Manager with an NGO. I (FATHER) am a Mechanical Engineer and my wife is a Arts Graduate and we reside in our self-owned house. We belong to a reputed family of Asansol. My late father was from Gurdaspur, Punjab. 
We are looking for a suitable match from a Punjabi family, with no preference to caste, and would expect the girl to actively participate in the family business after marriage. She should have schooled in English medium. Ideal educational qualification of the girl could be B.

I will describe myself as an independent, real, down to earth and easy going person with a great understanding and sense of humor which you may not observe as I am not getting too friendly especially on matrimonial site. I hope you do not consider it as rude. I have been on this site for a while but couldn't give it much attention. Now with increasing pressure from my family and friends I've decided to take it as a priority and finalize something ASAP. Still I am not in any mood to rush for marriage without knowing my partner. This is the main reason I took the bride search on myself so I could know the person I am going to be with forever. I may not appear as a perfect Muslim guy in my picture but I have strong faith in Allah and teachings of Islam, try offering prayers, have performed hajj and I do not do alcohol, party etc. I believe we all are needy and looking for someone so let's not fake our importance onto others and just be real and humble.
