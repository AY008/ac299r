Currently on OCI (akin to dual Citizenship) Cards in India, so we now travel on Canadian Passports only.

We are a small nuclear family of practicing Muslims, strictly against all forms of dowries and demands both paying and receiving.

"Thanx for stopping by my profile and having a luk at it...
Well, its too tough to describe yourself. I think others can do this in a better way but still as i have to do it, i am describing myself in few words.
But let me tell you that you will be able to judge me better when u communicate personally as i think its difficult to judge nyone on the basis of few words when its the question of life.

Even i wana clarify that those grooms who r seriously looking forward for marraige ,only they contact me or express interest.

As far as personality matters, it depends on how u consider me, values cannot be written in words. If marraige is concerned, u need to meet me instead of reading this .

I m a fun-loving girl who is very determined nd focused abt everything i do. I believe watever u do, give ur 100 percent into that by the end u should have complete satisfaction... I love my family nd my friends. M quite family-oriented girl but at the same time , enjoys life with my friends to the fullest. I hav completed my bachelors in commerce. I did Post Graduation Diploma in Finance Management nd presently i am doing MCOM ( business administration and management ) . I m in final year of mcom.
I am a great foodie person. Love to listen music, hang out with friends.
I wana spend my lilfe wit such a person who understands me, care for me nd who loves me a lot... I am a very possessive person so i need someone who can handle me well. In short i need a understanding, caring nd lovable person who accepts me as i am .
Well this is wat i can describe about myself in this small column...but would like to communicate personally so that a person can actually know wat kind of personality i am.... as wat i believe is that u can knw each other by knowing each other personally rather than just reading abt someone...
