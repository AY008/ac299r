I give family values high priority in life, something that I will never give up. I believe in living life to the fullest and I take life as it comes. I am a very religious person. Have immense faith in God and though I have had a very bad marriage which I pulled for 21 years. I would like to depict my views regarding marriage you must have heard people saying that we were married because we were in love but according to me it is the other way round... love is a result of good marriage. Of course it requires some ingredients to hold this notion true... these ingredients are whether both partners share the same goal about life whether they could communicate in every manner the fear/hesitance, his/her behavior in general and also whether you are ready to accept the person she/he is with no wild assumptions, no compromise, and no overlooking or underlooking of facts. I believe in accepting the person as he or she is than force myself to believe that, that person would change afterwards in extremes. If anyone of them is missing then the integrity of marriage is missing. Once these conditions are fulfilled to an acceptable level then marriage is nothing but a pleasurable journey!!! .

The fragrance of rain drenching the parched earth, the flash of lightning against an ink-blue sky, the temple bells chiming on festival day... itÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s these small pleasures in life that make me happy. I respect all religions and faiths. When I am passing by a church, gurudwara or masjid, my hands immediately fold into a Namaste as a mark of reverence. For me all religions are the same and lead to almighty. ItÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s just that each one professes it in a different way.

Do not believe in anything because it is spoken and rumoured by many.

Do not believe in anything (simply) because it is found written in your religious books.

Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders.

But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all then accept it and live up to it.""
