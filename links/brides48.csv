"Hi!! Vijaya here. 
I am a mature and understanding woman, who believes in living life to the fullest. 
The experience was of first marriage was very harsh-my partner was physically abusive, and did not provide the emotional support to my children, which they deserved. However, I was able to put my past behind it. 
My family-which consists of my brothers, my sister and parents, were very supportive of me. It is due to their support that I was able to raise both my children in a manner that I can be happy about. My daughter is now on her feet, she is working with a reputed IT firm. My son is appearing for his board exams. 
I will be very happy to accept his family (or children), and provide the same level of affection and care that I am looking for. 
I am a very good cook, I am well-organised, and have a creative instinct. All these qualities have helped me to run my small family happily all these years. I am a God-fearing person, and firmly believe that He guides us at every step. Whatever problems I have faced, I have been given the strength to fight them. And because of His kindness, I believe in counting my blessings, and being happy about them. 
REQUSTED-
