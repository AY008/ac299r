"Hi!
I am an outgoing, creative, social person who enjoys hanging out with friends and trying new things. I love to laugh, make others laugh, talk, listen and have a great time. My interests are varied and I am up for trying anything, at least once. I crave any sort of travel and adventure, even if it's just taking a new route to the grocery store :) I am a huge sports fan and enjoy both playing and watching. I'm also a pretty straight forward person--I call a spade a spade and like others who do the same. 

I have a rewarding career in education. I've taught math, started and run schools and now work as a consultant to school leaders. I love working with children and hope to have my own some day. 

I recently moved back to Michigan after living in Boston, Chicago, and Southern California, where I spent the last 9 years. My work allows me to live anywhere and I am happily, geographically flexible. 

I am the hybrid offspring of a Gujarati Vaishnav Father and Maharastrian Brahmin mother. I am very lucky to have two younger brothers who have trained me well--I know how to take a joke ;) 

All I want is a partner in crime who can make me laugh (even if it's at my own expense--I can handle it,) who has strength, and who demonstrates passion towards life. I am looking for a secure man with strong family values, who appreciates the good in others. A supportive partner who knows what he wants, has ambition and passion, and who lives a balanced life. I can offer all of the same in return. I see life as a team sport and am searching for the ultimate teammate.

"From the girl next door: Looking for my better half. I am sure you are out there somewhere, and with some luck, well bump into each other one of these days..

So who am I???

I was born and raised in India but I have lived in the states long  enough to become a blend of east and west and also maintaining family values. Family and friends are an integral part of my life. I rely on them when in need but I do consider myself very independent and self sufficient. 
I am ambitious and career oriented. I have earned a degree in Computer Science and have worked in the financial industry for over 8 yrs. Though it is not always easy I try to balance my personal and professional life.
I am passionate ab out life and I'm always seeking to try something different. I believe that trying different things in life is a way of uncovering the mystery of life and all that it has to offer. It amazes me how the more I discover about life the more I want to explore it further. I also believe that a positive outlook towards life makes this journey a lot simpler. This attitude helps me in situations when I make mistake, learn from the mistake and continue to work towards becoming a better person.
I strive to maintain a healthy life style. I spend time at the gym but do not confuse me for a health freak. I enjoy eating variety of food as long as it is vegeterian. Apart from working out, I indulge in various activities to stay fit and healthy. However I also like to have quiet days when I would stay home and just chill out -- watch TV or just read a book.
