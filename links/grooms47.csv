You will notice stereo type boiler plate boring description such as "".....down to earth, straight forward, good sense of humour...etc.."" in most of the profiles, of course with few exceptions.

So I leave it to U and request you to get in touch with me to know more and better by phone or profile name with yahoo dot kom and make your own independent evaluation that would be far more accuarate and fair.

I donÃât like to talk about everything now but it seems necessary to mention that I've been to a number of different countries as either trip or study that my longest stay was in the UK to study. 

Regarding my education, I'm a general practitioner by degree, but I was in the UK to complete a post-grad degree in bioengineering. I was rather successful with my studies but unfortunately, I ran into trouble with my supervisor and my sponsor. I could have completed the work if and only if I could stay in the UK. At that time, I was in the UK on student visa and though I found suitable positions to fit but according to the UKs regulations I had to leave there and re-enter and it was not possible at the time. The only way to pursue my post-grad work was to get married there that even it was suggested by some of my British friends. 
But unlike many other people, to marriage me was not the solution to staying in the UK because IÃâve always thought about marriage as a permanent relationship and not something to sort out visa problems!!!

Now, I have put this ad to find a match to sort both my study problem and my private life problem. Again, I would like to say that IÃâm not after finding a person to solve my visa problem and though completing my studies are very precious to me but marriage is something I donÃât like to risk on and I want to be with someone to really enjoy all aspects of life!

To be honest with you I'm looking for a good match particularly in the US, the UK, or Canada that specially for the latter I can immigrate there but I prefer to get married and settled at once. 

Anyway, if you think youÃâre the one that could make me happy for the rest of my life, please drop a few lines ASAP!!!
