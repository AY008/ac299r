"Hi, 

Thanks for visiting my profile. Let's start our relationship with trust and truth. My name is Ravi Kumar Gokanakonda. I follow truth and value human. I stand for it at any cost or price. 

This feeling for you: To-be spouse and her family I value you as a human and respect you as my own family. Please do not count me with religion or caste. Such act disturbs me and trusts me that will be the day we will spoil our own life. No individual man or woman on this earth is perfect including I and you. We (after united and take responsibilities as WIFE and Husband) can become PERFECT with the union of our unique positive energies, ethics and moral values.

To know the sweetness of the fruit, at any cost you need to taste it. In the same way, you can only know the person by starting a relationship with him instead of value the religion tag or caste label. I am ready to know you by starting the relationship. Are you open for the same?

I have a special respect towards Indian traditional woman. Though, I am modern but traditional values takes precedence than modern values. Marriage and marriage life will not be complete without two parameters which I will discuss with only my to-be spouse and my to-be family members along with my current family members.

I follow legitimate values for all the community which develops me as true human. Let?s talk more in our next communication. Thanks for your time and I hope you will be blessed with happiness, pleasure and treasure in life.

Greetings

"We are straight out of Bride and Prejudice ? a Sikh family, four sisters, a gorgeous mother and, of course, the eternal search for ?suitable boys?. The youngest sisters are twins, and my sister for who we have posted this ad, is one of the twins. 

GROWING UP: Dad served and retired as a Colonel in the Indian Army, and we grew up all over the country ? including big cities like Delhi and Kolkata, and on huge farm houses in smaller cities like Lucknow and Meerut. The summers of our childhood were spent at our grandparents? village ringed by emerald green fields in the Punjab. Or motoring up the highest bridge in the world and picnicking by the Indus in Ladakh. 

She studied at convent schools wherever Dad was posted at the time and then, in Class VIII, the twins went to study in a boarding school in the hills near Chandigarh. They insist they spent the best time of their lives there and frankly speaking, we are all quite jealous of their large, close-knit, persisting circle of friends. 

She studied MBA in Human Resources at an Army institute in that fun student town, Pune. While others partied, my sister worked her ass off. She can be the serious, committed sort. We all believe that the partying would have done her good. 

WORK: The serious, committed, focused person that she is, she has recruited and hired for brand new branches for an MNC bank. We have never seen her at work, but we won?t be surprised if her colleagues call her the Rock. She is currently in Pune working for IBM India.
HER: Of the four sisters, she?s brought home the biggest bonus, she bakes the best cakes, and she has the most beautiful eyes. She is quite boringly untiring about the way she helps her parents; the other twin can be quite a brat. She has bought her mom diamonds, she has let her twin raid her wardrobe. She, frankly speaking, needs to learn how to push back. She could also do better while making life decisions.

"Hi

To begin with, i would like to say that i basically belive, to live and let live others, i like indian culture and our value system especially. the close bonding that we share with our family, here i would like to state that i am blessed to have one such family. My family comprises of Dad, a Central Government Employee, Younger Bro who finished his B. E. and is working & my dad's eldest sis, i. e. my aunt. I lost my mom when i was quite young. I am very attached to my family. My brother being my best critic and i owe all my success to my aunt and dad.

I am very expressive and direct, very sensitive & glad that i am this way, as i am usually liked by everyone for this ( I owe this to my Psychology degree). I tend to give a lot of importance to emotions and the need to express them, i personally feel this was present in the indian culture but we are losing now as all of us are hard pressed for time and getting materialistic. I am very matured by my thinking and prefer others also to be this way.
Oh ya... i am ambitious but not at the cost of losing a family.... so i am highly family based. So i balance between my career and family and expect my man to do the same. I am currently doing my Ph. D in management.
Looking out for a person who is also equally sensitive and expressive of emotions, who tends to value the importance of others emotions even if he does not necessarily agree with it. He should be sensibile and oriented to the needs of family, should be achievement oriented but have the morals not to stamp on to others shoes to be successful. It would be great if he too has a blend of likingness for Indian culture and traditions and the modern views.
I would expect him to move into my family and be a part of my family and not just in my life, i vow to be the same towards him. I basically aim at two families getting together and not just two individuals.

"A Libran born at 12.30 pm on 28th September, 1980,  in a Brahmin family in Bhagalpur. We belong to ""Bhardwaj Gotraa"". I am 5.3 tall and weigh 50 kg.

My early childhood was spent in Assam. Schooling in St. Stephens, Tinsukia, SSPM Chiplun and Bhawans School, Bharuch.
Graduation took me to BMCC; Pune where I did commerce and then further pursued Post Graduation Diploma in Management from IIMM [2003].  First job and financial freedom came with Tata Infomedia where I worked for about a year. Better career prospects made me shift to ICICI Prudential where I spent four years making my way to Sales Manager. Next jump and promotion came with my joining Bajaj Allianz in October, '08. This is a challenging job and my responsibility as Regional Manager spans across the country with base in Mumbai. I do travel to various cities at least twice a month.
I quite enjoy my present job but would like to be in the financial sector in the years ahead. My total financial remunerations adds to six digit in a year.

Though working in Mumbai is hectic I do find time to indulge in weekend outing with family and long long drives. Reading preference is eclectic, inspirational and self motivating text being the current flavor. Good movies, music, both film and Indian classical is top on my activity list. Games, adventure sports and travel to exotic places is on my wish list. I value my family and am proud of our culture and traditions. Firmly believe in marriage and permanent relationships, and would happily give away all for a happy home and family.  Natural surrounding, company of people with substance and indulgence in activities where I can contribute as a person is what I cherish and long for.

My family consists of my parents and one sister and a brother. Sister is elder, engaged and working as a HR Manager in Patni Computers. Younger brother, a management post graduate has started his career with Ballarpur Industries, Delhi.  My father is a Chartered Accountant and is with Indorama Cements, Mumbai. His earlier jobs took us to Assam, Orissa, Gujarat and finally Maharashtra, where we now have a permanent base in Panvel [Mumbai]. Our ancestral home is in Rajasthan, though my grand parents lived in Bhagalpur. My mother's family is mostly settled in Assam.
