Someone that:

Has the same life values,
Is my best friend,
Can talk through things.

And also I guess these are related to the above though...

Someone that:

Is easy to talk to and communicate with (even though I'm not really much of a talker!),
Just gets me,
Supports my individual interests,
A little bit crazy from time to time...

I'm sure you subconsciously we know who you would like to be with but it's hard to think about it, and also not so good to put too many restraints on the whole thing.

"I was born in KGF, raised and educated in Bangalore. Studied ICSE in one of the Bangalore's prestigious convent schools, went on to do B.Sc from Sri Mahaveer Jain College, Bangalore. Completed my MCA as well, working as software engineer by profession for an MNC in Bangalore. I'm a mix of traditional and spiritual in my values and my religiosity is simplistic at best. I do not follow orthodox customs and practices. I'm a simple traditional Brahmin guy at heart, although modern in my thoughts and ideas and do not allow myself to be hedged in or suppressed by orthodoxy. Strong family values have been instilled in me from a very young age, and believe that your family is your strength, esp. your parents. Home and family life is something I feel strongly about. So for me, family is important, even the one I'm going to be part of. I'd love to be part of a small, close-knitted, loving, cultured family, who is very warm, accommodating, supportive, understanding, and are open minded. I'm a very straightforward person, super frank and direct. Freedom and personal space are supremely important to me. Generally affable, warm, reserved, eccentric, slightly impulsive and impatient at times, very affectionate, lively, fun & cheerful, passionate about learning, appreciative of art and nature, introspective, spiritual, these are some of the words that would describe me. I have varied interests in many areas. I like to read on a wide variety of subjects though Iâm mostly inclined towards philosophy, science, metaphysics, mysticism, the occult etc. Apart from that, carnatic music, vedic astrology (jyotisha), religion, spirituality, creative arts, nature, travel, cookery and photography are things that I'm into. Also, ancient scriptures and sacred texts or literature, old inscriptions and temple architecture are things that deeply interest me. Coming to marriage, i respect the sanctity of marriage and look forward to making a meaningful, loving & affectionate, peaceful and supportive relationship of it, where both partners respect each other, no one feels superior to the other, a deep bond of closeness is shared and where love, kindness, support and affection are expressed freely and warmly. Apart from that, I'm strongly insistent on having a long courtship period, anywhere between 3 to 6 months. Ours is family of just 2 members (mom and i) and my dad passed away 6 years back. My mom is traditional and religious and she has done her bit to give me a sense of tradition, culture, religion and heritage.

"I am Me. In all the world, there is no one else exactly like me. Everything that comes out of me is authentically mine, because I alone chose it -- I own everything about me: my body, my feelings, my mouth, my voice, all my actions, whether they be to others or myself. I own my fantasies, my dreams, my hopes, my fears. I own my triumphs and successes, all my failures and mistakes. Because I own all of me, I can become intimately acquainted with me. By so doing, I can love me and be friendly with all my parts. I know there are aspects about myself that puzzle me, and other aspects that I do not know -- but as long as I am friendly and loving to myself, I can courageously and hopefully look for solutions to the puzzles and ways to find out more about me. However I look and sound, whatever I say and do, and whatever I think and feel at a given moment in time is authentically me. If later some parts of how I looked, sounded, thought, and felt turn out to be unfitting, I can discard that which is unfitting, keep the rest, and invent something new for that which I discarded. I can see, hear, feel, think, say, and do. I have the tools to survive, to be close to others, to be productive, and to make sense and order out of the world of people and things outside of me. I own me, and therefore, I can engineer me. I am me, and I am Okay.


ÃâThe longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failure, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home. The remarkable thing is i have a choice everyday regarding the attitude i will embrace for that day. I cannot change my past... I cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. I cannot change the inevitable. The only thing i can do is play on the one string i have, and that is my ATTITUDE. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it.

I cant change the direction of the wind, but i can adjust ma sails to alwayz reach ma Destination!!!

I believe Impatience is the mark of Independence n not of Bondage!!!

I dun understand ppl who say life is a mystery...bcoz wut is it they want to knw....????

"About Ravi

I am 24 years old, was born in India but my family moved to Australia in 1988, just after my first birthday. I have been to India several times since to visit my grandparents and extended family, and always look forward to a holiday there. 

I am a qualified diagnostic radiographer, and am currently specialising in Medical Ultrasonography (I am studying my masters whilst working full-time as a trainee medical sonographer). I have a genuine passion for sonography and medical imaging, and find the actual work both challenging and stressful, yet extremely rewarding. 

I was raised and finished high school/year 12 in Canberra before moving to Sydney to study diagnostic radiography at the University of Sydney, which I completed in December 2007. Since then I have worked in various hospitals/practices in Canberra and Sydney. I am currently in Perth. In 2009 I purchased my first investment property (apartment) in Sydney, which I am renting to tenants. 

Being a very social person, I enjoy going out, having dinner or simply relaxing with my many good friends. Travelling is one of my biggest interests, and I make an attempt to go on an overseas holiday annually. In my spare time I also enjoy reading (everyday), going to the beach, playing/watching cricket (naturally, I support India), attempting to cook new foods and going for a drive in the car. 

I have been blessed with a good and privileged life which I mostly attribute to my parents who have always supported and counselled me in any endeavour I wished to pursue, many true friends and a job that I find exciting and purposeful.

I have only one younger brother and currently doing Apprenticeship final year Hospitality and Trade in Canberra

"The fragrance of rain drenching the parched earth, the flash of lightning against an ink-blue sky, the temple bells chiming on festival day... itÃâs these small pleasures in life that make me happy. For me, festivals related to Lord Krishna are very important ÃÂ­ he is our family deity after all. But I respect all religions and faiths. When I am passing by a church, gurudwara or masjid, my hands immediately fold into a Namaste as a mark of reverence. For me all religions are the same and lead to almighty. ItÃâs just that each one professes it in a different way. My soul mate should respect my sentiments. For a relationship to be successful, it must be based on mutual understanding. Just as I donÃât expect my partner to blindly follow my faith, he too should give me the space to follow mine.	I am a civil engineer, based in india. Though I have been living here for more than 20 years, I would say I am still a villager at heart. I hail form a small village in india. I love cricket, strolling down sarson fields, eating sugarcane and being happy all the time. I am always high on life, thereÃâs never a dull moment. But if there is something bogging me down, I rush to the gurudwara to soak in its sanctity and fell at peace with myself.

My idea of soul mate is not the usual gori-kudi type. She should be a simple, God-fearing person with a golden heart and immense humility. And yes, she should be a great cook, so that we could sometimes offer langer from our home, sweet home.

"Hi, I was born in Pune, and I have stayed here all my life. I am a software engineer by profession (completed by B.E in IT in 2009), working in MNC in Pune since last 4 years. Although I have managed to succeed in my current job, I am contemplating moving to Mumbai (work-wise, over the week days at least) in near future (by September), to further my career as well as financial aspirations. I have a keen interest in watching football, and playing cricket. I was a state level cricketer, having represented Maharashtra in various age groups, and I was even contemplating pursuing it as a career at one point of time, only for it to take a backseat to academics. Currently, I play cricket on weekends for my company and club. What I'd like in a girl are good values, someone who belongs to a very good family, someone who is smart, motivated, and has the determination and willingness to succeed and be the best in her field (whatever that may be). I am a believer of girls being much more financially independent, and I would go out of the way to support her aspirations, and make her succeed. I also expect her to be a good communicator, and expect her as well as myself to stand besides each other, compromise for the other whenever needed, and make a successful relationship. More important that anything else however, is my feeling of utmost respect for parents, and I would prefer someone who is gladly willing to share with me, the responsibilities for both sets of parents, as they grow older, and forever being there to support them.

Spirituality comes first rather than being mere ""church goers"". Our Lord said, ""Where two or three are (truly) gathered in my name, there I AM in the midst of them"". This is the true life system our Lord established in all it's simplicity and purity on earth. A true Christian is one who loves the Lord with all his heart, soul, mind and strength, even if you are alone or few in number and don't have a denomination/group to back you. Are you one in love and faith towards God only as a family. That's more than
enough. Most of present day churches are mere ""Social setups"" or ""Sunday clubs"" and have become a big stumbling block to many drawing them away from Christ, whereas they ought to be leaders truly leading others to Christ. These are surely the last days before our Lord comes back judging the world and we ought to be prepared and ready to meet HIM alone and yet as a family.",26,Sia,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Agra University,Central Government,5ft,SMM1624754,Muslim
