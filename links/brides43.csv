"I AM HIV POSITIVE.

I guess this is where one is supposed to put their best foot forward, make an impression. But I think I shall just try to make an honest attempt at describing myself to the best of my knowledge and then leave it to you to decide if you want to get in touch, because I'm looking for a real, lifelong relationship and for that, we better know each other for who we really are.

So, here goes - I believe I'm a good hearted, attractive, intelligent person who is also fun loving and romantic. 
Most importantly, I am dependable and I don't play games.

I like to work for a living and also value my independence. However, I value people and relationships over everything else and am looking forward to starting a new phase of my life with the person who I will completely depend on for love, friendship, companionship, understanding, and just about everything. Needless to say, he can expect the same from me.

Who am I looking for? - Well, if you like what you've read so far then you're probably my kind of guy. On a serious note, I want someone who has dependable shoulders, the willingness and passion to walk beside his partner through thick and thin. I want someone who is liberal in attitude and lifestyle but has sound moral values. Would like someone who is fairly well educated, intelligent, and fun loving. 

I could go on and on but then I know there's no such thing as a perfect partner, at the end of the day its all about chemistry to begin with and then compatibility. So I shall leave it at this and wait to hear from you.

My likes - I like to travel (have travelled in India &amp; abroad), books (across genres, currently interested in self development), music (once trained in Indian classical, hope to get back to it), eating out (I enjoy restaurants & home cooked food altho not much of a cook yet), and perhaps, most importantly, the company of family and friends. I was not born to be a loner :-)

It is always hard to define who we are looking for without sounding inflexible but I would ideally like my partner to be affectionate, fun loving, with a good sense of humour. I am looking for an individual with diverse interests. He could be living anywhere, doing anything. 

I believe that relationships have to take time to grow, that it develops in a continuum rather than just pop up at a point in time. I would therefore like to start off as friends and see where that takes us.

But I am just as happy staying home and hanging out friends and family. I would like to meet someone who has similar interests, but who can introduce different activities into my life. 
My ideal match would be someone who is kind and considerate, generous and thoughtful, easy-going and funny. Someone who is not chained to their job, their computer or cell phone would be a plus. Nothing wrong with being a go-getter, but there has to be a good balance, don't you think? Someone who is mature, responsible and intelligent. Someone who puts butterflies in my stomach. Someone who effortlessly makes me laugh. Someone who isn't afraid to make a decision if needed. It would be nice to find a relationship where each person's personality and attitude compliments the other. I also think building upon a friendship first is the way to go.
