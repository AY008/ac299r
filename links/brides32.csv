"ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃËBeauty without grace is the hook without the baitÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢, this is a well-said thought by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Beauty does not depend on the number of times you visit the parlor. It totally depends on the way of carrying yourself. If you have grace in your body then you are the most beautiful person on earth.
I consider myself beautiful because I feel it from inside. I try to remain as graceful as I can and this makes me feel I look good. The other reason why I feel I am beautiful is my heart. I am a very clean-hearted person and I am sure that even if I have wrinkles on my face one day I will still feel I the same as my heart will remain the same. 
I am an IT Professional but I am not working at the moment because of some reason. I am sure when I start working I will acquire what I have set as my goal. 
My father is an Executive Engineer and he has always been my inspiration. I feel that whatever I am today is because of my parents. Other than that, I have loads of friends and I like all of them. I trust them completely and most of the times when I am free I hang around with them.

I come from a south Indian family, born & raised in Bangalore. I love nature, music and chess.

Spirituality interests me a lot and strongly believe in God, yet am broad minded in my approach towards life. I have a blend of both traditional Indian values and western ethics. 

My type of ideal life partner is someone who is nice, simple, well read, caring and compassionate, one who's inclined to family and friends and is an optimist.

If you marry the wrong person, no amount of effort on your part can fix it, and no number of good circumstances can make it bearable. This was true in my life too. 

Unfortunately, I had been a victim to this circumstance. But life has to move on for me. I have accepted the reality as some bad moments of my life and looking forward for a good companion who believes in being friendly and caring towards relationship. 

I guess the point is, you have to marry the right person, and the circumstances don't honestly matter that much. Marriage is a life time commitment and experience, it is not an experiment.

All the best in your partner search.",32,Vishwakarma,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Karanataka University,Private Sector,5ft,SMF1580221,Hindu

I am now working as a Sales and Marketing professional for an MNC in Mumbai. I believe implicitly in myself and all my inner strength comes from my family's strong support. I have a wide variety of interests - I don't watch much of TV, but can't say the same about movies; I can ski, skate, sketch and even embroider at times! It depends on my mood and the inspiration. I read a lot. I detest superficiality in any form and of course, bad manners, too! I am completely bowled over by the old-fashioned chivalry and polite manners :) I don't like many action and horror movies, love animations (any kind, any language), adore Calvin and Hobbes, write a bit and sometimes wish that I could sing very well. I am sure you will get to know more about me when we correspond.

"Thank you for reading my profile. 
Education-wise, I am a BSc medical graduate and presently employed as a Student Visa Consultant in an immigration consultant company. Having worked for over 6 years in various multinational companies, I now want to settle down in marriage with a compatable person. I am also willing to relocate with the committed person and together explore, understand and share life's different phases.
Being a very exuberant and lively person, I love travelling and making new friends and acquaintances. My attitude toward life and work is very positive and I believe in living life to the fullest. Along with interest in music and yoga, I also help in household activities like cooking, decorating and cleaning.
Whenever I am free I am generally with my friends, sometimes on an excursion or a walk in the hills or shopping or watching a movie or listening to music. Though I love freedom, at the same time I respect my elders and value my Indian culture. 
I strongly believe that relationships are not meant to be analysed but lived to the fullest. I think if we go around judging each otherÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢??ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢??ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢s worth then there would not be enough time to understand and love each other. Since it takes two to tango, therefore, both need to adjust to make the relationship work. Also, ego should have no place in a love relationship as I feel it is not possible to love someone unless you are selfless.
There are other qualities that shape me, some may be good and some bad (though not repulsive), but that is best left to be discovered later. I am genuinely modern in my thinking and outlook and very open to ideas and suggestions. I love and know how to appreciate the ÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢??ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃÆ?ÃÆÃâ¦?righteousnessÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢??ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢??ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ in humans and value the power of love and trust which makes life truly worth living in companionship.

In short, I am a fun-loving, caring and a homely girl, yet professional in my work, outgoing in spirit and confident in nature.

Its just that each one professes it in a different way. My soul mate should respect my sentiments. For a relationship to be successful, it must be based on mutual understanding.

"I grew up in a family with lots of love in an environment that encouraged intellectual growth and a happy-go-lucky attitude. Most weekends of my childhood were spent traveling, camping and going on adventurous journeys with family, while at the same time being taught the importance of education and being sent to good schools. There was never any pressure to top at school, and all that has been expected of me and my brother is that we are better human beings than good professionals. I inherit this happy-go-lucky, adventurous, free-spirited attitude from my parents, while being a good human being who respects our traditions and values. I have traveled to Africa, Australia, some parts of Europe and Asia keeping up with the family tradition!! People who know me see me as a strange but interesting mix of a traditionalist with modern ideas, a conformist with a liking for anything anti-establishment, and a push-over with a mind of her own. Other than this, I have a deep love for music and intellectual conversations, and feel a special bond with people who have a flair for either. But, when it comes to my life partner, all I wish for is a person who I feel a connect with.

After a hard day's work, I like to relax with a book or a movie. I'm not a very gregarious person and I have a total of 1 close friend. But I can get along with most people. I love eating and keep trying out new salads at home. I would like to travel but I haven't gotten around to doing that too much.  
I guess I do all the regular things the way everyone does them, but at the end of the day, I think I know what I want to do. I don't mean to sound like some geek who's got everything figured out or some weirdo who thinks the aliens are coming! I believe that above and beyond the mind and body culture, there is a soul culture that I need to focus on. In fact that's first on my to-do list.  I'm a compassionate person and I have a very low pain threshold when it comes to others - a wounded dog or a field of wilting crops can make me very sad. Somehow, I'm very sensitive to the sorrow and pain of people and that makes me look very seriously for a way out. And I believe there is a way out.
