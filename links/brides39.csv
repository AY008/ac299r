"I consider myself to be an open-minded and cheerful individual. I was born in Hyderabad, but raised in different parts of the country.Having completed my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engg. from Hyderabad, I came to US in 2001 to pursue a Masters program in Electrical and Computer Engg. I am now on H1 B.

I like to spend time with my family and socialize with friends and people who are compatible with my interests. In my free time I usually like to do some light reading( my all time favourites are Archies, Tin Tin and Kalvin & Hobbes.),listen to music or simply enjoy being outdoors with my friends.My hobbies are cooking and reading stuff on occult sciences.

My friends describe me as very understanding, dependable and a passionate person. They appreciate me for my sense of humor and good dressing sense. Having been raised in an army atmosphere has incultivated liberal thinking in me and has exposed me to a society where men are very bold, sophisticated, polite, chivalrous and treat women with respect. Someone with such qualities and prefers a partner like this would be an excellent match to me.Though such an exposure has given me a modren outlook, The strong religious roots at home hold me down to islamic morals and virtues. I like to workout in the gym as and when time permits, but love going out on long walks. I am religious and traditional, but yet open to western ideas. I think i have a good blend of both, the East and the West.
