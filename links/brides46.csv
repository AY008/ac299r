Comunication- You need to be able to talk to your partner and trust that they will take into consideration you thoughts and opinions. If your relationship lacks this one simple quality, then you may as well be kissing a brick wall.

Comprimise- Both partners need to be able to give a little. One reason I believe alot of relationships fail is because one or both partners are selfish and want things their way.

Common goals- It is important to discuss with you partner things such as plans for your life, and wether or not you want children. 

Loyalty- It is VERY important to find someone who believes in commitment and will be loyal to you in marrige or in any relationship.

Love- There is a difference between Infatuation and Love. Dont let your heart get in the way of your mind and reason. Give it time to mature and dont hgo making any long term commitments until your sure that what your feeling is real.Be sure that you partner is will to do the same.


Humor- I love to laugh, and I love people who make me laugh.

There also has to be respect, consideration, and an ear or two to listen with.

I love listening to indian classical music and ofcourse the contemporary blends that musicians churn out nowadays. Am proud of our culture and our country.. . 

I am looking for a companion who is cultured, articulate, can express himself well (not to be confused with just good talkers), , belives in equality of sexes, open minded, very honest, happy and down-to-earth and is capable of loving and accepting someone else's child. This may not be easy but, well after what i have been through and what I am left with, I guess these have become standards for me. Looks are secondary. I, in return am willing to do the same, as in, would love to take on the upbringing of another person's child. No double standards for me. 

I could have thought of bringing up my child all on my own, but the thought of spending my old age all alone is not something I fancy. I would love to spend my life with a person and his famly I can respect and love. This may make me sound boring, drab and wishy washy. Well let me tell you, I am not that at all. I can have pillow fights with the one i choose, play tickling matches, go for long drives by the river (ahem.. if one exists in delhi), get wet in the rain, spend a cozy evening together watching a movie with wine and ofcourse one who is Mine!!
My parents hail from pakistan and are punjabis. They moved to Delhi post partition. Dad is from the army and is retired now. Mom stays at home to look after the family. I have a 5 year old son who is the best thing that could have happened to me in the last few years. My family is great and our upbringing has been full of fun, love and laughter, and ofcourse has been liberal. I have 2 elder sisters and a younger brother and all of them are married and settled abroad. Don't know if this matters!!
