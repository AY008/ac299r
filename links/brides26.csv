I am who I am thanks to my mum and especially my late dad although he is not here today, I believe that he has helped me through my teens spiritually to be the intelligent girl that I am today.
A small family : my mum, my 2 elder brothers. My dad passed away when I was 13. Was my dad's favorite and well the apple of his eye, I would say. Other than that, the next closest person to me right now is my mum. My mum is my most important person to me, and seeing her happy makes me the happiest person on earth. I believe in having my own family too someday, in which I hope to see my mum to be part of it as well.

I always find a way to pull myself together regardless what life throws at me...It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing. It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for dreams, for the adventure of being alive. It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow. It doesn't interest me if the story you're telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul. I want to know if you can be faithful and therefore trustworthy. I want to know if you can see the beauty even if it's not pretty everyday. perfectionists and whatever I do, I need to do it thoroughly and get it exactly right or I feel dissatisfied.
