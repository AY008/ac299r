Looking  for  one  special  who has  risen  above the myopic vision of life, understands & realized that  life is just a short journey through  time & space  of  planet  earth , and the  best way to utilize  this opportunity is to live in peace ,harmony,&  happiness , live life  the best possible way we can in total  awareness & mindful of  others  that their peace  is not disturbed. Am I a dreamer..? may be ? for me life itself  is a dream -
(as in dream nothing really happening  but  still seems  so real where all senses and emotions are active and responding  but when you wake up you realize  ,whoops  it was just a dream).

Is that  you ? I am looking  for, one who is in awaken  state  and  sees life in its true &  absolute  form . carries  no baggage from past , are you naturally  blissful from  within , are you child  like yet wise & mature as situation  demands . you fall in category  of soul mate. have no illusion  about yourself.  All I would say is, you are priceless.

I am not a preacher  of poverty neither  an advocate  for materialism ,believe  in middle path (what ever   comes  naturally without hurting anybody or self) the buzz words  are  content, happy, blissful, these are the  most  precious things in life.

"This is the second time I've come to this page to write about myself. The first time I had no idea what to write. I then started asking people what I was like and got a lot of opinions. Most were similar, so I'll write them down. People say my main asset is my sense of humour (Ya, right. I'm sure you heard that before. This time it's true. ) and my happy attitude towards life. I feel life is to short to take seriously, but long enough to plan ahead for a future. I also believe money isn't the end all of life, I believe in God, in all things beautiful, people(I still think there's hope for humanity), my partner and most of all I believe in GOOD FOOD (I owned 2 American-Italian restaurants). I am a creature of my environment. I feel at home in the lap of luxury of a 5 star hotel or in a one room shack (provided its on a Goan beach: ) Just kiddin'). So in a nutshell I'm happy, easy going, chilled, peaceful, laid back yet ambition, hard working and goal oriented.

A little about my past: Born U.S., 4th std to Bsc Bangalore, back to U.S. for Engg, owned Greek American restaurant in U.S., sold business, moved to India 1993 to be with parents, married 1994, opened restaurant in chennai, divorced 1999, sold restaurants2008, have communications firm till date. This is the Readers Digest version. Full version available for perusal after sacrificing pinky finger.

Well, I guess I finally got through this. I hope I pass the test.

Looking for: Enough about me for now. Lets get to you. I obviously gel with people having traits similar to mine.

I work for a large American MNC.

I am not perfect by any means, I am honest (sometimes a little direct!), hard working, and have done quite well form myself thru God's grace, hard work and a little luck.

I am well traveled, my work takes me around the Asia Pacific and the USA.

I am guided by my conscience and I am God fearing. I have traveled around India extensively, and really enjoy Indian food, music and culture.

I am concerned about the environment, and love wildlife sanctuaries and National Parks. I used to play lots of sport in my youth - badminton, squash, hockey, tennis. Nowadays I go for long brisk walks to get my required cardiovascular exercise.

I try and do good and give charity, as I believe good things happen to kind people. 

I love kids and sadly don't have any yet - willing to give myself another chance at happiness. 

I have a close knit family, my late father believed in spending lots of time with us and I hope to do the same if blessed with a good wife.

I respect elders, and am not ostentatious.

I believe in God, though I don't wear my religious convistions on my sleeve.

I love travel, the calming effects of North Indian classical music, and chilling out with good friends.

I'm fairly health conscious, and in fairly good health and exercise quite regularly.

I try to be happy. 

I wish you good luck in your search for happiness.",50,,Others,,MNC,5ft 9in,othm339929,Hindu
