After deep study, thinking, imagination, and soul-search, I map out new married lifestyle, which is woman oriented and will deliver divine love, care and supreme happiness (cosmic enlightenment) to couple. In this woman-oriented system, husband has to live with the parents of wife, just like matriarchy system society.There is other basic difference in this system. Now I want to live in it. After that I want to promote in the whole world, so people will live happy and lovely married life. I am 6 ft. tall, and 60kg body weight bachelor.

"Well, I am pretty easy to get along with. I gel and get along with most people. I am pretty much confident and can hold the attention of people as well as a good conversation. I like having fun, not at the cost of others though. I am quite religious and believe every person is here for a purpose. And for that he has been gifted the necessary strength and qualities. I discovered this only recently, pretty late in life. Live and let live. I do not judge - for good or bad, since it immediately elevates or demotes the other person or you thereby creating an invisible barrier between you and the other person. I also balance the modern values and traditional thinking reasonably well.

At the risk of sounding immodest, I will also say that I am a perfect gentleman, and know how to treat a lady right. Oh, I almost forgot, I have an impeccable character.

I like watching movies (English - action, martial arts or new Hindi), listening to music.... I like Hindi pop, Hindi movie songs, Hindi pop, English pop, Soft Rock, Instrumental - English and Hindi general and classical. Yanni is a favorite. Reading is another good past time... especially John Grisham courtroom Dramas, self-improvement books (like 7 habits of highly effective people, etc.) management books, etc. I used to be very active in martial arts earlier and now work out at the gym or go for a walk or run. While I am not much into sports, I do enjoy watching Cricket and Formula racing on TV. I am very much interested in science, following business developments. I am a big foodie and love all kinds of vegetarian or eggetarian foods.  I love singing and am a good singer. Non professional, though. AND, I am a fan?tastic joke teller :) 

I am pretty much an emotional person... can't and don't want to hide my true emotions. I hate liars and manipulators. 

I guess I am looking for the kind of love one would see in movies ? the romantic dreamer in me?.:). The lady, who is destined to be my partner, will find out after marriage that she will besides being my wife, will always remain my best friend and girlfriend also (keeping the romance alive forever).

After certain events in my life, I have learnt to become unstoppable i.e. if I set out to do something, I follow that doggedly, relentlessly, and do not let up till it is done and achieved. I give it more than 100.",46,Marwari,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",,,5ft 4in,mumm481326,Hindu
