"Personality: I have lived at many places in India and north America and I need not say that I respect all the cultures, religions etc. Of all the places I have lived at, I like Vancouver and Delhi the most. I would like to describe myself as an optimistic, a fighter and yes, witty. I am a voracious reader-a habit quite common in my family-read anything I can put my hands on, but of late, I have been reading a lot on serious political issues (ranging from India to Ireland to Mid-East), but I love reading lighthearted once in a while-I just finished re-reading all the Tom Sawyer series-took me thru my childhood. This habit of reading has made me capable of thinking from multiple viewpoints and has helped me being tolerant and adjustable. Rest, I believe you can better judge someone only after meeting him or her for a couple of times. 
Long Term Goals: I have been teaching Physics in a local college. I never thought I could ever be a teacher leave aside being a good one. But I realized that I like most when I am around my students. And at times I don't hesitate going a little out of way to help my students and its very rewarding to see when they try to do the same for me. However, I intend to change my path to WORK in non-profit sector (and this is something other than social work). We can talk about it more when we get in touch. And finally, here are some things I am looking in the person I would want to share my life with: someone with moderate-cum-traditional outlook, genuinely compassionate for society, trustworthy and faithful, optimistic and interested in literature, able to hold conversation in different situations & certainly not a braggadocio type- a thorough gentleman. This is a life-long relationship and I can tell you one thing for sure, I will give my 100%. It would be a relationship where we would be each others strength and where we would go thru every good or bad phase of the life together.

My friends describe me as: lively, friendly, trust worthy, good listener, a little introvert but once I get to know the person well, there would be no dull moment and to add romantic too.
Values: I believe in honesty, sincerity - be it work or personal life, live and let live attitude, respect for elders and lot of love for children, believe in giving and sharing all the beautiful things of life, love to help the needy and always there to help anyone who needs me. 
Hobbies: I love to read (fiction/non-fiction), cooking (experimenting :P ), travelling, arts and craft, calligraphy and handwriting analysis. 
Views on marriage: Marriage is about trust, companionship, complimenting each other, balancing highs and lows in life and being there for each other come what may. Marriage accordingly to me is such a pure and ethereal bond that should grow strong with years, its more of a special 'something' that two people share and come to realise a special feeling that the world calls 'love'. And last but not the least, respect for each other and the strength to stand for each other in trying times.
They say marriages are made in heaven and even though the wait is long 'someone somewhere is made for each one of us'. Waiting to find the special someone that God has chosen for me. Lets see if you can find me before I find you.

What I am looking for is a good combination of values and outlook; well educated and mature guy who loves life and also knows how to live happily. 

Icing on the cake would be if you are tall (cant help but a tall guy with nice smile and sparkling eyes gets noticed by me quickly though not a mandate as a life partner is a lot more than eyes n smile :p) 

I believe similar interests help but chemistry and connect is all that matters so if you are a decent nice guy who has been busy working all this while and now wants to settle down and I am a bit of something which you are looking for?we can talk more.

The minute you close your hand and squeeze tightly to hold on, the sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold onto some of it, but most will be spilled. A relationship is like that. Held loosely, with respect and freedom for the other person, it is likely to remain intact.

We spent our childhood in Dhule, where we rose from a very weak financial situation to one of well-stabled position of today.

"I was born and brought-up in Bombay or Mumbai. I have studied and worked in Mumbai. I have done B.com & have also done Master Diploma in Computer Science. I am working as a teacher for past 7 years. I am currently working for Dhirubhai Ambani International School, Mumbai as a Computer Faculty & as a Student Council Advisor.   My career is important to me and I believe in my capabilities of maintaining a good balance between my professional and personal life. I do believe that one must dream and also try to achieve it but at the same time be smart enough to distinguish between possible and the impossible. Failures, I believe are not the stops to success but the stepping stones to it. Honesty, integrity and loyalty are values I strongly believe in and can proudly say that I have them deeply embedded in me. I am friendly, easy going, helpful and modest by nature. I have always enjoyed adventure sports like trekking, camping, white water rafting and so have been to Hrishikesh - Foothills of Himalayas. I enjoy socialising with selected friends, watching good movies and reading good books, travelling and taking pictures/photography (not professional). Marriage to me would be a life time union between two like minded people who are refreshingly different in their own ways. The twosome, who could spend time in compatible silence or do many different things together, yet offer each other enough space to be their own person. Two people being able to share their innermost feelings and thoughts without the fear of being judged. I am looking for a life-partner who is loving, accommodating and simple in thoughts. I believe trust, understanding and compromise (not sacrifice) are the life support systems of every strong and lasting relationship, so I would expect these qualities in my partner and yes he sure can expect the same from me too. He should be a good friend so that together we can share our good & bad times. If you feel you would like to get to know me or you need to know some thing in particular please feel free to mail or good luck to you.

"Social Work has its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the Industrial Revolution; in particular the struggle of society to deal with poverty and its resultant problems. Dealing with poverty was the main focus of early social work and therefore social work is intricately linked with the idea of charity work; but must now be understood in much broader terms. For instance it is not uncommon for modern social workers to find themselves dealing with the consequences arising from many other 'social problems' such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and age and physical/ mental ability discrimination. Modern social workers can be found helping to deal with the consequences of these, and many other social maladies, in all areas of the human services; and many other fields besides.
