While growing up in India and watching my parents devote their life to raise us, I learnt a valuable lesson of life - that children are our future.

No wonder some of his friends have declared me the coolest dad who likes to play with and motivate them. 

To know more about myself and my expectations of my spouse, I decided to put perfectmatch. com to test for their profile analysis. Here is the gist of my profile analysis by perfectmatch. 

""I am cautious at the beginnings of relationships not to fall in love too fast. However, my optimistic nature looks to the possible rather than to the difficulties that may lie ahead. I am likely to put my love at the center of my life and I need someone who wants to be there. I take time for love and I need someone with the same priority. However, I do like varied experiences, so my life needs growth, change and perhaps, adventure. Boredom and habit are a part of all long-term relationships. I need someone who, like myself, will need to keep life (and the relationship) stimulating and new. I am the universal connector. I get along with just about everyone, except perhaps a serious Introvert. I am flexible enough to meet the challenge! In any case, I have the tools to be a great partner: I am not insecure in relationships, I like to work with someone on creating a life together, I don't get upset easily and seek intimacy and open up my heart to a partner.

"Sensitive and well-bred due to very loving and caring parents;who despite being highly educated and being ambitious, thought of their two sons more than anything else. I expect also to be a parent like them. As we are extremely well-off, dowry is a taboo, and considered an insult. Thus my life partner should be decent, well educated woman of empathetic and aesthetic nature. I wish to remain in All India Radio as Producer, but I shall continue my forays in to Bollywood, as training from FTII never goes to any waste. I wish to be a greater writer than my father, that shall be my way of paying respect to my folks. 
Incidentally I always wanted to be a pilot, doctor, broadcaster&writer in that order while growing up!My parents did not let me join Naval Avionics!I myself left Maulana Azad Medical College, Delhi after one boring year!After graduation, I taught English Literature for a while and sat for my exams for All India Radio, got in and joined as a producer at an enviable(yet I always felt at an immature)age of 22. But something lacked in life, it kind of hit you while driving to FM transmission early in morning or driving back home at midnight!Since I was 5 or6 years of age, I had been mesmerised by my dad bent on his desk, writing!
I decided to go for film writing instead of literature and yet whether it was an indirect or direct wish, this was something which dawned upon me when I was 36. In order to fulfill that desire;I decided to sit for FTII's Screenplay course as a student, after putting in 13 years in All India Radio, Delhi as Programme Executive(PEX)/Producer. All India Radio, Delhi is one of the most action filled places one can wish for, as is broadcast journalism/programming, but I felt stiffled as I was considered an expert in non-fiction programmes on AIR FM and other channels. It was this that impelled me to again become a student at rather an advanced age, but liked and encouraged by my younger batchmates I topped the course & was sent on deputation to FTII(The Film &Television Institute of India, Pune)from AIR, Delhi as Associate professor&Officer on Special Duty to director of FTII. 
My life partner must like literature, art, music, movies and have a distinct identity & personality of her own. I hope to be a partner in her growth as an individual, and off course some one you will spend your rest of the life with. 
The most important thing that I've learnt watching my parents is committment. My mother was my father's strongest ally, critic and counselor all rolled into one, while he served as First Secretary(Education&Culture)in Indian Highcommissions in Trinidad&Tobago and later in Mauritius. Now that she's afflicted with immobility due to two strokes occurring simultaneously in 2001, my father tends to her all by himself, refusing to hire any personal nurse. 
Money is something that nobody in our family is unduly worried about, as both ancestral as well as self accquired is what would qualify us as extremely well off. However money is something you spend to live and not something you live for-I would expect my future partner to understand that.",45,Gupta,"Delhi, Delhi, India",,Central Government,5ft 7in,naveenair,Hindu
