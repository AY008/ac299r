"Self-dependent, self-brought person being raised by mother and my elder brother who expired in June 2007 in a road accident. Am convent educated but had to drop out in BSc Finaly year because of family situation and came in to field. Have worked in Pharmaceutical in marketing and in office and then switched over to Medical Transcriptionst profession where have got around 10 years of experience.  Have a small family, myself and my mother.

Family wise, as such, what to say, we have/had a very, very big family 6 sisters and one brother from mother's side and 6 brothers from father's side.  But unfortunately due to early demise of father, and nobody came forward to help, myself and my brother were single handedly brought up by my mother and there had never been any contact with any of the so called big family anytime in my life.

hence we had a quite tough time but yet we were convent educated and hence our future was well secured in that sense.  curtsey, mother's hard work and approach to life.  

We had our hair cut after the 84 episode.

then my brother started his career with pharma and things changed for better and then we shifted to lucknow.  he got married in 94. but here again the better half of my brother turned out to be not a made for each other type of match.  yet they carried on with life after an initial 1-1/2 year separation.  they had one son earlier and then one son after their reunion.  but unfortunately on june 11 2007 my brother expired in a road accident and because of earlief issues and after his death coupled with the fact that huge money came in from insurance and other sources, she went her way and now we really do not have any link with them.

So, as on date, on the family front, it is me and my mother only.

profession wise, I also started working quite early in my life with teaching and then in pharma.  have worked in different profiles, as a office assistant to office manager, then medical representative, then area manager and then came in to this medical transcription profession.  right now am working from home only and my working hours are around 9-11 hours on average and income ranges from 25 to 35,000.

I also own a small house, 4 marla, 100 gajj.  this house was purchased just 2 months before brother's death and we had planned, because we had very good understanding, something else and hence we had the both name on the property, and hence it was a small worry for me but when I looked all options legal and otherwise there was nothign to worry for me. because we had the majority amount in loan and am handling that.  on the property of 15.5 lacs we had taken loan of 12.80 lacs from loan and in legal terms they cannot claim and as such what they can claim is only till the time of his death which had calculated comes to 1 lac only and that too i am to give to someone on their side which i have asked to get the matter sorted and take the money or else forget it.  as such, mother is staying with me and her share a big one, but we never ever had such intention when he was alive, so we never ever thought of going on that lines.

Though Qatar is a Muslim country but everybody is free about their cultural liberalization, about 1.2 million citizen called Qatari among other 8 lakh foreign expatriates, including Indian and other asians Americans, British, French, Italian are among the others. Doha, the heart of Qatar,  is an absolute cultural melt pot. The stunning newly built high rise buildings and towers on sea coast carries the glamour and proud of the city.
I had my legalized issueless mutual separation in 2005. And since then I am absolutely alone and leading a complete simple bachelor life. I have a lovely 8-years-old son, Subhra, studying std.III staying in hostel in Barasat under my parents' supervision backed by my sister at my native home town Thakurnagar, North 24 pgs.  
A generous family support & love helped me to overcome myself from that crisis period and resumed to have a normal life. Principally I was decided not to marry again but my parents insisted me every time to do so and I have realized the importance and the value of a partner who will be by my side for the rest of my life. I do strongly believe in the capabilities of women to make things more organized and redirect into proper destinations. I respect women.
One innocent child deserted abundantly from its most deserved maternal love. And I have to be ready to answer. I need somebody's help who can able to play a role heartedly and understand above all. Of course I will marry for myself not for the child & she will stay with me in abroad far away from my son but responsibilities must be laid in her mind. 
About my family background:
 I have been brought up with a traditional lower middle class joint family which comprises my parents, my elder brother and my younger sister who are both married. My brother is separated having one son and a daughter both are studying. My sister is working who has one daughter. My father was a small business man who was just able to manage to bring up us and who gave us foundation of honesty, family values, ethics and respect to my elders. Presently he is taking care of our few land properties; just he is passing his time. My mother is very emotional and a devoted house wife, she likes to cook and worship. Normally we are atheist and we are quite happy by the grass of God. Precisely I have my own new house and few land properties which is quite productive. But we are not rich, same way we are not poor also.

My instinct hobbies:
My hobbies include working with computers, surfing the net, reading news papers and listening music. I like to read and know current affairs happening around the world. I am simply a fond fan of cricket and football of any kind. I smoke moderately with branded cigarette, although I hate smoking which I quit several times.  I can't drink at all.
Future plans and ambitions:
To be married April or May 2009 and I will be happiest if she doesn't carry anything from her parents'. I hate dowry. To be built or buy another house and then settle in city either Kolkata or Mumbai/New Delhi, ",41,Bengali,Others,,Private Sector,5ft 7in,wesm422234,Hindu

Undoubtedly, most of us would not choose these tough teachers, but it seems that the teachers choose us. The choice that we have is whether to learn and grow from these lessons, or to resist and struggle. Embracing the learning in a situation gives a positive aspect to the worst that can happen in our lives. A few of the biggest truths that I have learned from both the good and bad experiences in my life are: Nothing is ever Ã¢â¬Åas good as it get.Ã¢â¬? You tend to get what you focus on. There is always a choice. There is always a way. Despite all obstacles itÃ¢â¬â¢s an amazing world. Gratitude is a choice. Whatever our  surroundings, we can create our own sense of space. Your past determines your present, but you determine your future. Applying common knowledge in an uncommon way is the basis of success. It's not magic and anyone can do it.

You should know that Money can buouse but not a home, it it can buy something 2sleep but not sleep, it can buy a clock but not time, it can buy a book but not knowledge, it can buy a position but not respect, it can buy medicine but not health, it can buy you a spouse but not love, it can buy you pounds of blood but not life, it can buy you riches but not happiness and satisfaction, it can buy ''one'' the best place to be buried but not a place in heaven. You see, money is not everything in life .I need true love, I need to be love and beloved. I would give up anything just to be with my love. Anything is possible But I am seeking true love . .

"Hi Every body.Its never easy to write abt one self but let me give it a try.. here it goes... 
I am simple god fearing person I am well focused in life. Strong family values & mixture of east & western. I am a career oriented person.I consider myself to be caring, sincere and committed person. I believe i m a warm person and possess an approachable personality but yes it takes me a while to be myself. My friends think i m good fun to be with and i kinda agree with them. I m a good listener and i hope that i m a trusting and considerate friend & cares abt people who cross my path. I love to laugh (keeps me younger, i kno i kno wat u thinking.. seeing is believing, i agree with u on that one)and i love being around ppl who believe in the same. Its always nice to smile and make ppl around u smile, it just adds value to the face. I believe in being happy and content with all that ALLAH has blessed me with rather than crying over wat i dont possess. Not that i can complain, Allah has been very kind.. I m not a person without faults either but try to improve myself as best as i can. I m God fearing and try to fulfil the basic principles and be a better person. I have respect for my faith and culture & values but also have a modern outlook on things. 

Loyalty is a very important to me. I am loyal to those who are in my life & expect the same in return. I appreciate fine things in life. I like to spend quality time with people who are important to me. I try n`live a balanced life making time for myself, family & friends. I am not superficial. What you see is what you get. 

I believe communication is he essence of any good relationship. I cherish my relaionship with family & friends. They are important part of my life. Apart from spending tme with the loved once I love to spend time with myself. 

I like reading, music, going out, watching movies & traveling. 

WHATS I AM LOOKING IN MY SOULMATE 

I am looking for a decent, family oriented women with good sence of humor & a positive attitude towords life. 

I am searching for my soul mate!A comfortable partner with whom I can be myself. Someone who knows the value of relationships. I am looking someone who will never rob me of the place she gave me in her life & belives that marriage is a life time commitment. Its important that I be able to trust my partner, as she would me. 

I am looking for someone who is not not only my partner but my best friend, someone who is respectful of my feelings, my family & friends, Someone who is attractive to me & has a romantic side. 
My idea of a fulfiling relationship doing funny things together, laugh together, exploring new things together, being together doing nothing, being together in good times life time togetherness is what I am looking for giving space to each other at the same time. Someone who I can love n`cherish for the rest of my life. 
I believe you just once. Give your best & try to get the best out of it. 
Ialso strongly believe that relationships dont work on their own. You make them work. You need to keep nourishing them. Dont ever take them granted. 
If you realy know what it take to make a relationship work, I would love to hear from you

"The profile belongs to a friend of ours who is one of the sweetest and admirable persons we have in our circle. Very unfortunately he was divorced after a very brief marriage of few weeks in 2005. It didn?t last more than a few weeks because of extreme incompatibility and a hassle free divorce by mutual consent followed soon after. Though extremely disappointed he has finally agreed to look at life afresh after persistent pressure from family and friends and we would like our friend to be settled as early as possible and enjoy a blissful married life which he rightly and richly deserves.

He is an M.B.A and works in a senior position in a MNC Firm and has a successful career during which he been posted in various places in India and had a short stint abroad. Despite a fair amount of national and international travelling he is pretty attached to his roots and would probably try out entrepreneurial ventures of his own some day.
 
He has a multifarious and rounded personality and stands out in any crowd. He is an avid reader and is at home with most subjects and in any setting. He has a strong cultural grounding and very refined tastes enjoys a wide range of music and arts starting from modern pop and blues to classical music and cultural events. He enjoys traveling and is passionate about outdoors, nature and wildlife. He used to be good sportsperson in school and college and has extremely high energy levels and is a born athlete. On the looks front he is tall, fair and pretty good looking and looks much younger than his age. He used to carry the tag of the most eligible bachelor of the group until the ill fated accident in his circle. Beyond everything he has a very high sense of moral values and a steadfast determination of sticking to principles. Although he has a modern outlook he also has a strong Indian value system and still believes in the concept of a happy married life and lifelong companionship based on the simple tenets of sharing common goals and bringing up a happy family. He is crazy about children and is the favorite uncle of all his nephews and nieces and little children around.

He is the only son of his family and his father after retirement as a senior officer in the government service tragically passed away a year after retirement. That is also a reason why he had earlier put on hold his marriage to stabilise the family. His mother is a very simple, sweet and affectionate home maker who alternates her time between his sisters and Bhubaneshwar. He has two very lovable younger sisters who are happily married and very well settled. They belong to a very cultured and highly respected family of Orissa now settled in Bhubaneshwar where he has his own house

Since this would be an arranged marriage, it's imminent that the respective families be involved in this discussion at the earliest but having been through one bad experience he would probably like to first interact with the prospective brides? families and if they are comfortable they could then take the issue forward. His only condition is his insistence on an extremely simple marriage. Responses to this profile will be replied directly by him.",41,Brahmin,"Rest of Orissa, Orissa, India",,,6ft,orim376816,Hindu
