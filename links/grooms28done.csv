"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step and it seems today a journey of a lifetime begins with a single click! I am making this profile on the recommendation of my parents.

I am an MBA from FMS- Delhi University and have been working in the education sector.Consequently the search for greater responsibility and learning led me to prepare for a career in the civil services. I appeared for the Civil Services Mains in 2011 and this year as well. This time I am quite hopeful of getting through. But as anyone with any experience of this exam would tell you this is a highly subjective process.

My father being an army officer I have traveled all over the country and grew up mostly in Chandigarh. Thus I speak Hindi, Punjabi, English and Malayalam fluently with a smattering of Assamese. 

Another consequence of my diverse experiences has been that my friendships are unbounded by ethnicity. Thus I count Punjabis, Assamese, Biharis among others as my loyal friends

My Hobbies include

Travelling- I have been all over the country and to Nepal and Bhutan. The last place I visited was Ladakh-truly magical!.I have been fortunate enough to have participated in adventure sports right from white water rafting, to rappelling to rock climbing.

Writing- I write poetry and short analytical essays. A minor ambition of my life is to leave behind a great work of art

Music and Guitar- I listen to bands like Silk Route, Pink Floyd, Dire Straits, Grand Funk Railroad, Deep Purple though I am not averse to Pop and country artists llike Adele and Taylor Swift. Even New Age artists like Kitaro and Peter gabriel appeal. The only thing I cannot tolerate is rap!!!!
My guitar playing has been described as ""noise"" by my father but nevermind! :)

"Soul mates seek completion through the relationship experience, spiritual partners are complete individuals who are drawn together by the law of resonance and once together their alignment creates an entirely new energy which is also complete.

Soul mates mirror lessons to each other. Spiritual partners mirror God.

Soul mates love, but usually with agendas attached. Spiritual partners love without agendas.

Because soul mates need each other to complete the karmic lesson(s) which aligned their lives, freedom is not easily experienced within this paradigm.

Soul mates often seek the validation of their significant other with questions ranging from ÃâWhy donÃât you ever say ÃâI love youÃâ, to ÃâDoes this outfit make me look thin?Ãâ Spiritual partners love their partners without the need of validationÃâ¦ to love them is what gives them joy and feeling loved by them is not required for peace of mind.

I was a merit ranker in 10th std. I am very ambitious, emotional, caring and romantic guy and independent decision maker. I respect my parents. I respect all the art forms, being an inborn artist. I love painting and drawing. I enjoy reading on variety of topics like my technical programming books, literature, novels, short stories, business world and financial magazines too, as financial literacy is equally important. I listen to all sorts of music depending upon the mood. I prefer football over the cricket. Being a keen observer, I try to learn almost everything. I believe that marriage is based upon the pillars of trust, love and mutual respect and that one must be honest with his or her partner. I respect others viewpoints and I generally adjust well with most of the people. Also I don't wear the glasses now, as I underwent Lasik few months back from very reputed eye surgeon in Mumbai, so don't need them now. Having good sense of humour, perfect blend of modern looks and cultural values. ",28,Koshti,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",Mumbai University,MNC,5ft 9in,rajkjs2006,Hindu
