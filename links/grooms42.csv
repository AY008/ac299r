A bit daunted with dipping my toe into the cyber-pool, but ok, here goes. 
Thanks for taking the time to read my pitch. I don't think I'll launch into my autobiography at this moment, just briefly, I come from a traditional, yet progressive, very well respected Muslim family. 

I love life and would like to share my passion for life with someone special. 

I am an active person and I play all kinds of sports as well as horse ride. IÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢ÃâÃÂ¢m a bit of a movie buff, but tend to be more inclined towards those with happy endings. 

I have a passion for the arts, musical performances from flamenco to salsa to Verdi's requiem, art galleries and sipping on a cup of coffee at a local coffee shop, although nothing comes close to a half-cup of Desi tea after a long hard day at the office - Champion!
 
One of my addictions is travel, the adrenalin rush of packing up and dislocating to an unfamiliar location even for longer periods than a holiday - nothing like treading in unfamiliar waters and immersing oneself in different cultures. 
Is there any fun in life without surprises?
 
I believe marriage is a partnership and believe that each partner must learn to appreciate the others strengths. I am family oriented and am looking for someone who believes strongly in family values.

I've been fortunate to come from a good family originally from India (U. P). I was born and raised in the UK. I probably have more of a western influence, but many aspects of Indian culture are sprinkled in my life.

"I would describe myself as a bon vivant, forever optimistic, forever flippant, upbeat, confident, self-aware (often painfully so), shy yet gregarious regular Joe kind of guy. I have lived in over 22 countries, and can pretty much get along with most people. I am very empathetic and a good listener and talk a lot at times. Am a social liberal (way off the charts), fiscally conservative in the collective, fiscal liberal in the individual. 

The East would call me a hermit; the West would call me anhedonstic. I am more tuned into pleasures of the intellect; as a consequence, I am very introspective and abstract (woolly headed :)) and spend more time thinking than anything else. I read/write philosophy and psychology outside of work; play the violin and generally lounge around doing nothing other times. 

I am a businessperson with a portfolio of tech product companies in various stages of growth from early stage onwards. I split my work time between the US, UK and India. 

I have learned to let go of a pre-defined set of expectations in my partner, probably because for most people (myself included) self-representation is different from reality. 
Would definitely prefer somebody who looks physically compatible to me (I am reed thin neck downwards). While I definitely get along with most people (and love repetition :)) I would definitely like somebody who is fiercely independent and values my need for me-time/space as much as she likes hers.

"They say that it is quite hard to win a woman while marryingÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦but... me say the very word 'WIN' undermine her entity... it is rather more important to let her feel that in groom's characteristics her aspirations are met to an admissible extent ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦and reward is... she will bestow her hand, heart and soulÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦. Please go on to read 

I feel I can be described for matrimonial information as: 

-	A successful professional who is self made 
-	Being intelligent and articulate 
-	Being neatly dressed 
- Good looking and being well-groomed

I value and acknowledge the sanctity of life- long- marriage relationship. 

I cherish my high paced, social welfare oriented job of being an Editor in a news magazine. It gives me opportunity to experience & handle the different faces of lifeÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦from interaction with highest power wielders to hear the most destitute within short period. Ride in a Limousine and bullock cart within hours. This high flying and amphibious, as well, job had taken me to wide national and international placesÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦hence made me more aware and Humane.. able to see life in totality.. And being whistle blower to the society is more rewarding than a individualistic job. After all gaining a ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÅLicense to shootÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ã? & ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÅMaimÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ã?... albeit with camera and penÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦right from head of state to commoners is far more meaningful than to secure a million dollar profession ..where more the salary...more the target...more the responsibility...less & less time...all the luxuries but no quality time for near and dear one.

I love to explore place, like to travel and trekking, open to new experiments, have creative bent of mind, sophisticated taste. Am extrovert, jovial and outreaching type. Positive thinking and Fun loving. 

Mine is a respectable Punjabi lineage with Hindu-Sikh mixed family. Thorough bred in cosmopolitan cities, both mother and father passed away. One brother and a Sister, both elder to me, are married and living in Delhi. Dad was world famous ace camera engineer. 

I am blesses with good health genre that me and family have no known history of hereditary diseases like asthma, diabetes, cancer, heart or others. 

I am very Liberal in religious values, a non ritualistic believer. Close to Sufism. 

Am looking for a women who is at same wavelength, progressive, awake to her rights and duties of marriage institution. With sense of humor, tasteful, classy and humane. Within compatible parameters of our mutual physique attritions. 


I am aware and confident to deliver that as a husband I am dutiful to give limitless and lifelong care, affection, space, support, attention and love to my soul mateÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦I mean it. 

Literally being a single soul i can afford to relocate should the need demands.

ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦Well, I really donÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢t know where to start. I havenÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢t had to update my professional resume in years either, but I can't leave my search for life partner special to chance. 

So, to describe meÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦
My background is Sri Lankan, was born in Sri Lanka but left at a young age to live in Africa for 10 years. Now living in Toronto Canada for 20 years. 
I have a good blend of eastern and western cultures. By nature I am a friendly person, down-to-earth, ambitious, hard working, funny, caring, sensitive, and honest with real zest for real life striving for challenges and face them with optimism. 

IÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢m in good shape, take care of my body and appreciate others who do as well. TheyÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢re also more likely to understand me spending time in the gym :-) I appreciate a wide variety of music and love to dance. IÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢m willing to try almost anything at least once. I really enjoy playing nearly any sport, but IÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢m far from a master of any. The fun is in improving. If youÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢re looking for someone who'll learn something new with you, IÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢m a good candidate.

I come from a nuclear family, have a younger brother, a Doctor and both my parents are retired processionals living in Toronto.

From an educational and professional aspect,
All my post-secondary education was in Toronto and have a degree in Engineering from McMaster University. Currently employed as a Software development project manager for a major north-American insurance company. Been with the company for 14 years so I am pretty content professionally.

Ok now what am I looking for?
IÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢m looking for a lady I find attractive (both inside and out), with whom I find chemistry, to care about and who'll care about me. Someone whoÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢ll share my love of the outdoors, games, parties, animals, travel, the simpler things and inspires me to want to be her perfect man.

If this peaks your interest, drop me a note.
Please include photographs when responding.
