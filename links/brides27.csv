"Every person in this world wants to fly. They want to see the earth from a different prospective and want to let themselves loose. More than anything in this world, I envy the birds. Ever since I was small, I dreamt of flying in the sky. I loved the idea of just spreading my wings and flying high in the air. 
When I became the Flying Officer in the Indian Air Force, I was over whelmed. I thought I was very lucky as I got the chance of doing what I always wanted to do. Along with that, I got a chance to work in the best of the organizations in India. 
 In future, I would like to become the Squadron Leader in Air Force. As of now, this is my dream and I am sure I will achieve it. Apart from that, I am very strict and strong about my decisions and if I decide something, I do not change it for anything in the world. This is very helpful sometimes but there are times when I suffer because of this. 
My profession has taught me to be very disciplined and strict. I always like sticking to my schedule as this gives me a peace of mind and keeps me satisfied. My parents are well educated and are working in the best of the organizations as professionals. 
Apart from that, I am very good at sports and love to play games. This not only keeps me fit but also keeps my mind fresh. I have a habit of watching a movie every Friday. I feel fresh after this and for some time forget everything. ",27,Brahmin - Sanadya,"Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India",,Central Government,5ft 6in,bhof1291736,Hindu

Something in her own words:

Hi. I am Meghna. I am a simple and friendly person. I am quite adjusting and believe in honesty. I am an avid reader and enjoy all branches of literature, whether it is prose or poetry, short stories or novels, even comics!!!  :-) My favourite authors are Jane Austen, Gardener, Christie, Stout, Maclean, Sharatchandra, K.M.Munshi etc.

I have done a 2 yr. diploma course in French language. I have recently cleared NET. I am a career-oriented person, but I am totally dedicated to my family. My idea of life is to try and live each day in such a manner that we deserve to live yet another day and so on and on. I try to infuse each day with positive energy and enthusiasm and do not shy away from hard work since at present I am enjoying both my family and professional life. 

From my grand father I have inherited a taste for the old and traditional, and from my mom I have acquired  an unflinching and daring modern spirit to accept new challenges and turn them into assets. This is reflected in my tastes as well. I love songs and movies, both old and new, ranging from those of Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor to those of SRK and Abhishek Bachchan.  Some of the movies I have enjoyed are: benhur, king arthur, a walk to remember, head over heels, wedding planner, the last samurai, pride and prejudice(starring keira knightley), little women etc. Among hindi movies some of my favourites are meera, jogan, nau do gyarah,sarfarosh etc. Pakistani plays like dhoop kinare, tanhaiyan etc. are near to my heart.
