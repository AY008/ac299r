Unlike other profiles, my daughter don?t claim to be a beautiful, charming or a good-looking girl as she strongly believe that what is attractive to one, may not be the same for another. And then, don?t forget, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

Now talking about her interests, she is a voracious reader and writing is a passion for her.  It is the way she express herself. She is  quite obsessed with Queen?s English and proof of it is that hardly a day passes  her without  consulting a dictionary five-10 times.

Photography also interests  and she did a short course but unfortunately could not pursue it further. Most of her time  spent in reading, writing and consulting a dictionary, whatever time is left is divided among  family and a very few precious friends.

She also like spending time and interacting with the aged as she strongly believe that they are storehouses of knowledge. She is much concerned about aged people and look after them very well. She is very discipline and punctual. She  like watching good cinema and travelling to new places. At times, she don?t even mind watching soap serials.

"Born and brought up in Mumbai, I blossom in the company of dear and trusted people around me, both family and friends. While I may take some time to get to know someone, once that trust and comfort level develops, I open up and love to share feelings and experiences. On weekends I like to relax and unwind with my friends and family. I go out shopping with my friends, go for a movie or spend the day at home with my family. I imagine people around me would describe me as honest and dependable. I work in HR and deal with various issues of my colleagues, and more than it being 'just a job', I genuinely enjoy helping them. At my core, I can be a young girl, giggling and smiling away, but when duty calls, I can be responsible and sober too. At heart finally, I am a 'simple' girl and do not need very much to be genuinely happy. I am looking for a man who will understand me and with whom I can genuinely be myself.

Someone who does not play head games is straight-forward, enjoys trying new things and places and is fairly romantic.
