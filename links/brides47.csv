Likes:
 appreciate integrity, those who form own opinions and ideas. 
Progressive thinkers and those wear a beautiful smile and have a positive outlook on life.
 Simple, straight forward people who can easily talk about anything and everything
Green Open spaces. People who look after themselves physically  

Me: Am artistic, creative and stylish. Caring, well balanced, sporty and lead an active lifestyle. Interests include pottering around bookshops, keeping fit, city breaks but not done too much travelling this year. Love tropical plants and Far Eastern Art eg Japanese, cookery and hanging out with my friends and family. 
 
Am here because I am hoping to meet someone who is from a progressive urban family like myself. I am a caring person and would want the same in return. Not here to play games with someone and dont want others playing games with my heart either. I know there are people out here for that, so please excuse if you have different intents from mine and good luck. 

I dont have a picture of the person I want to meet in mind and am not interested in his worldly wealth nor past. He simply has to have a generous attitude and loving heart. Thats it! 
Oh yes, although I am educated in the UK and love the great outdoors and keeping fit and travelling, it doesnt make me less Indian.

I am definitely in it for the long haul and realise that it takes time and effort to make anything work. 
 
You: you are a n/s and what works is someone between 40-47( issueless), as this is the same age bracket, a professional but it doesnt matter what you do just so long as you enjoy it. You have to have a kind genuine, honest heart and be broad minded and humble! YOu dont have to have extraordinary pastimes, such as parachuting every other day:-) just a regular man... yes, really! A great smile and the ability to make someone laugh would be great!
 YOu would be down to earth, son of the soil, mature headed, warm and mild mannered. 

He would be very lucky as my family tells me I have a lot to offer the right man. 

 If English is not your first language then I am definintely not the one for you and wish you luck.  
I am willing to relocate for the right person, be it India, US or in UK anywhere
