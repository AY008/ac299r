"ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÅThe best use of life is to spend it for something that outlasts the lifeÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ã? was famously quoted by Mr. William James. I strongly (at times, strangely as well) believe in the purpose of endeavoring tasks and not in their outcome. The outcome may be positive or negative, but if the purpose is worthy and is holy / noble, I always give my best attempt to it. 
In this beautiful Universe, every single aspect (both living and non-living) centers on and being propelled by a unique plan that is predetermined. So far, I have been hard-laboring as to what God has intended for me and have been giving the best in drawing myself closer to Him.
Moving onto the kind of person that I am.ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¦ well, I can easily convince / woo almost anyone through both verbal and non-verbal communication, as I am being reckoned as an expert in this domain. Therefore, I do not want to sound to be sweet. I try to emulate my role-model in every single way and have been remaining quite uncomplicated so far.
I do not want to blurt as to who my role-model is at a public medium, especially in such a matrimonial portal, and believe in walking the good-path than talking about the good-path merely. To put it in a nutshell, I am highly spiritual in practical life, and constantly run towards the best in everything that I pursue. I have a lot of future plans and strictly want to live by moral / ethical values. I work hard to be more Christ-like rather than just be ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃËyet-anotherÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢ Christian, and so I am much uncomplicated.
I have been adjudicated to be one of the very best  (at least regionally) in the spheres such as Behavioral Modification Training , Imparting Training / Coaching on IT, Communication Skills (Verbal and Non-Verbal), US-based IT Business Development   Strategies, Copy-Writing , Creative and Script Writing, Web-based / Creative and Artistic Solutions using Design / Multimedia Suite, Lean Practices and Six Sigma Methodology (at Green-belt Level), Research work by amalgamating Neuropsychology with Computer Science (bagged some regional and national-level awards in this process, already. Actually I am awaiting my PhD Admission Card and Guide Allocation from one of the Central Universities in India. Have bunches of Certificates / Testimonials on all of the foregoing.) 
(Well, if you or your ward only looks for a life-partner who would make her happy throughout the life; without reasonably sharing the riches / blessings that God has given her through her husband and without leading a life of significant morals / values ; then I am a misfit for her hundred over hundred. Please do not waste your time in my profile.)

Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes. 

I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like countryÃâs peace, I like metropolisÃâ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh. 

I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote ""Les Miserable"", or like Roman Roland who wrote ""John Christopher"". They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read peopleÃâs mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.

"My likes change a lot with time and new experiences. I am quite flexible in ideas and it feels as though I have not decided yet. I am constantly observing and thinking about everything I experience. I try not to disturb the natural order of things and be more of an observer than trying to influence my line of thought onto others. To each their own!

Anyway to track my life history, I was born in Ranchi, brought up mostly in Vizag and after my PGDM in Lucknow have been in Mumbai since May 2005.

I work in the IT industry and would most likely continue to do so. This means that there would be a decent amount of travel that I would need to undertake. This doesn't mean I would always be away. I will strive to maintain a balance between family responsibility and work responsibility.

Music is something which never ceases to fascinate with the affect it has on me. I may not be very knowledgeable in all the genres, but I enjoy most of what I hear. If there is something I've not yet discovered, well then that is an opportunity I never pass by. Whether I have anything else or not, my home will always have good sounding audio equipment. 

There was a time in my life when I was crazy about computer games. Although that time is over, I still try to keep myself abreast with the latest happenings in the gaming world.

As a kid, sometimes I used to watch excessive amounts of television. Thankfully that phase is long gone now. The inane TV serials on mainstream TV channels these days which show a fantasy and sickening world of unbelievable joint families has aided in this disillusionment. The little amount of TV I watch these days is happily spent on watching either informative channels like National Geographic, History, Travel and Living, cartoon channels and comedy serials for their sheer entertainment value and certain programs (Gadget Guru and Car & Bike Show) in channels like NDTV Profit. This of course brings me to my other passions.

Gadgets had always been something I craved for. As a kid if it was mostly about watches, as an adult that passion has matured into a one for mobiles, cameras and all other convergence devices this digital age has brought upon us.

Like gadgets, cars too have been something I was always passionate about. What I like most is to be able to drive on quite, traffic-less roads listening to good music. That of course is not possible in many of India's cities. In Vizag, we had an old ambassador that I had learned driving in. To people who don't know, Vizag is a place with great scenic beauty. There is a long road called beach road. This particular road is a pleasure to drive in. It is flanked on one side with the sea and on the other side with the small hills of the eastern ghats. Many a weekends of our family were spent on long drives along this long beach road. I have very pleasurable nostalgic memories of those times.

Journeys have always been something which I longed for. So much so that I like the journey more than the destination. When I reach some place, I want to travel more. I enjoy the changing sights during the travel more than the bliss of having reached somewhere. The passion of being on the move is always more than the satisfaction of having reached the target.

I am not very worldly wise when it comes to maintaining relations with relatives. Maybe its because dad was always on a transferable job and we had limited contact with our relatives during the summer holidays. For us, it was a very closely knit unity in our family of four with limited if not negligible influence of relatives.

I have tried to give as much information about myself in the 4000 words we get here. I wont say that I am a simple person, because I know I am not. This writeup hardly describes the complete me. In fact probably no writeup can describe a person. Otherwise the complex dynamics of human relationships would be rather easy to unravel.

I believe in God and My spiritual journey is driven by karma which ultimately carves one's Kismat. I believe that the supreme being is within each one of us and our every action is a means to approach him.

regards,
Pradeep

"Being South Indians, the only relation to South India till about 8 years back was that I was born there. Raised in Mumbai for the early part of my life, our family moved to Delhi since then (No my dad is not in the army!! Common question which I'm always asked). Having done most of my schooling and graduation(Maths (H)) from New Delhi, I moved to Chennai to pursue my Masters in Computer Applications and have been in Chennai ever since (around 8 years now). 

Being Telugu, Mulakanadu Brahmins (haling from Tamil Nadu) and brought up in Delhi and Mumbai, I have had little trouble in adjusting with people and culture around me (of-course, this also has been my nemesis at times!!). And even before I could realise, I was a part of the whole IT bandwagon,a company spawned robot with the only goal of helping the company better its previous quarter results.

The good (or bad) thing is that I still am a part of the IT industry. Am working with one of India's premier companies and I think I have had a fairly decent growth in my corporate life over the years (6 now). Have spent half of my corporate life abroad (UK, Japan and US). In-fact, am currently put up in NJ, United Sates.

Have a good attitude, respect women and am highly ambitious. Enjoy sports,music, reading and writing and rest assured that would make sure that I give more than 100 to keep my partner happy. Am looking for someone who is decent looking,can relate to me and vice-versa, who has a good attitude towards life is confident and would gel well with me. I would really prefer a career oriented partner who is educated,employed and is independent as I would not want my partner to sit at home after marriage. 

To pen a few lines about my family, they are based out of Delhi. Mom works for Central Govt in New Delhi and Dad is retired. Have a younger brother who works with ABN Amro (now Royal Bank of Scotland) in Delhi. 

If you think, we suit each other, please contact me. Wishing you luck in your future endeavours. ",32,Brahmin,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",,,5ft 9in,chem1319109,Hindu

"About me as a person :-
""Someday
When the world is warm
And the flowers are full in bloom
You'll come to be with me
And finally you may see
All that I can be for you 

Someday
When the days are long
And the sun shines brightly in the sky
You'll look at me the way I look at you
And see me the way that I see you
A beautiful being to me 

Someday
When the full moon shines
And reflects beautifully on the bay
You'll look into my eyes, and say you love me
And tell me all that you want to be
And see I'd do anything for you 

Someday
When my dreams have been realized
And everything is right with the world
You'll see deep within my heart is you
And know there's nothing I won't do
And just the same, love me 

Someday
When the earth and heaven are one
And we all walk together hand in hand
You'll have a place in your heart for me
But for now, it's only just a dream
Until you see how I care for you.""




Ã¢â¬ÅThe happiest business in all the world is that of making friends, And no investment on the street pays larger dividends, For life is more than stocks and bonds, and love than rate percent, And he who gives in friendship's name shall reap what he hasÃ¢â¬? 

THAT IS ME...........................

Attitude is more important than facts.
It is more important than the past, than education than money, than circumstances, than failures, than success,
than what other people think or say or do.
It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill.
It will make or break a company, a home, a relationship.
The remarkable thing is we have a choice, every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for the day.
We cannot change our past. We cannot change the fact that other people will act in a certain way.
We cannot change the inevitable.
The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude.

My hobbies : stamps/coins collection ,Reading,Hollywood movies/music, making friends ,philosophy ,poems ,Gyming and lot more..
 

About my family:

Have two brothers eldest is in Russia for Medical Research (he is MBBS/MD/Phd) married to a doctor Wife (BAMS), elder brother (Diploma in Ayurvedic Medicines not practicing) is a Real estate agent (for sales/re-sales of flat)married to a Tutor plus Housewife having 2 kids.

We were in Kuwait and have migrated during Gulf war to India.

My dad is into gifts store vendor. Mom is Housewife.

 

When I think about marriage, it starts with maturity Ãâmaturity is always there in men but it depends in some places they are not. ThatÃâs why they search for life partners but on some places She takes the command in hand.

 

As every thing is not perfect so both are fifty-fifty. So they shouldnÃât have any discrimination or competition instead! For me it does not matter whether wife earns more or less, important thing is peace and happiness between us.

 

I am a broad-minded guy but at the same time I respect my religion.
I expect from my life partner to be broadminded.

 

I would more like to play a role of partner then husband for her. Because only as a partner/friend we can share things from kitchen to office.

 

At every step of life I would like to be with her. And anytime if I fail she should be with me and there should a freedom between us to express each otherÃâs mistake and correct it without quarrelling

Only thing that should exist will be love and friendship!

 

For me wife is Friend and some one who left her home not to serve a boy but to help eachother in his life! Two couples mean the power of 2! Where 2 is even number and means good luck in life! This can be only achieved when both feel for each other.

 

One should not see always negative but help each other in making that negative point in positive way.

  

Now something about my priorities in life, it starts with my wife & Family, my wife should be one of the happiest woman in world second one is my career, third to do something good that the world will remember me.

 

Hope it was not very heavy, I tried my best to present you myself. If you want to see then my snap is in profile.

"I'm romantic and practical, fun and serious (sometimes I need a partner to help me unwind and laugh more), tolerant and have high standards, confident and scared. I'm full of enthusiastic initiative and possibilities and get stopped when criticized, like cleanliness and neatness but often get busy and clutter surfaces or get surprised by dust in the corners. I like to cook healthy food but don't do gourmet or vegan, like tea but not coffee, naturally take the lead and yet can work in collaborative groups. I focus on continuous improvement of everything, but try not to offer editing comments without agreement, love nature but not into outdoor or extreme sports, enjoy exercising regularly, but it tends to be Bike riding, movies and traveling. I like being hospitable, but get nervous about cooking for groups or people for the first time. I?m not very into pets but can live with them in moderation. I have no debt, travel a lot but not very excited about the hassle, prefer the practical application of spiritual
principles rather than convoluted philosophical discussions. I'm a planner rather than into surprises, but can be spontaneous on occasion. I need regular contact with nature (flowers, trees, water), but I like being close to the amenities of mid-size cities. I appreciate a variety of melodious music, but often cant associate singers and songs together. I read a lot, but often its novels to unwind or work related, and I rarely watch TV. I tend to be less concerned with material things but engage in lots of communication, spiritual activities, and affection.

"        my friends describe me as sensitive, emotional by heart, naughty by mind, caring for other, and fun loving person.

        Masters from Kingston university-2010, and worked with T-mobile for 1year just for expression and currently taking care of business. Love to explore new places, I like to keep myself busy in some or other stuff so that I can learn new thing from that expression. If I get time from my schedule than I move to gym.

        Expecting a sweet as sugar, understanding, sensitive, loving, caring wife cum friend. She should help me in my business. And respects the individuality of every person and is ready to do what it takes to be the best spouse and adjust in all needs and cares of everyday life.

        That's all
