"Mutual respect, trust & love constitute the base of a successful marriage and a successful marriage emerges from being the right mate, rather than finding one. I have very high regards for women and I don't believe in treating women merely as 'objects'. Since childhood I have seen in our society; whether she is a mother, wife, daughter or sister: in every role a female does lots of sacrifices for the well being of everyone (till her last breath) but in return she hardly gets what she is entitled to. My goals in life include achieving happiness through spiritual growth, enjoying both eastern and western culture, spending time with family and close friends thus simply living life in great spirits. People say I am confident, kind hearted, a good listener, caring, sensitive, always stand up for my near and dear ones, having good sense of humour, having cool temperament who likes to forgive and forget.

" Ã¢â¬ÅA new beginning and there will be a new endÃ¢â¬?... Just a random thought from nowhere...... 

Or should I just use one of the very standard opening lines here ( A dilemma indeed ), something like..... 

Oh this is tough...... 

What should I write here? Ã¢â¬Â¦. 

I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know where to start Ã¢â¬Â¦.. 

I have not done this before (and as if all of you have done it like 50 times before :-p)...... 

My friends or family pushed me into this (Really? Then they should take care of my membership fee... lol)....... 

Jokes apart, I guess this is where I am supposed to bombard you with adjectives about myself! Allow me to indulge. Ã¢â¬Â¦.. I am _____I am _______I am ________ I am ______ Well, At least Ã¢â¬ÅI amÃ¢â¬? sure you will be able to fill in the blanks but after reading the profileÃ¢â¬Â¦ (ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a trick just to make sure that you read the entire thing :-p) Nah, I canÃ¢â¬â¢t boast about myself to save my life. Modest Ã¢â¬Ëeh? (This is so not going to fly, I think)

OK, NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION (or at least I think I do).. 

ME-----------

In the lows and HIGHS of this journey called life, I now feel I need a companion. Not because I am scared to tread alone; but because now is the time to create memories and live to cherish them. (These lines are not mine, I stole it from somewhereÃ¢â¬Â¦. But I couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t have done a better job, for that matter, or even the justice in telling you how I feel about marriage). The most important thing for me is always being a happy person at heart and living life the best way I can. (LetÃ¢â¬â¢s just say it takes simple things to make me happy!). I am fun loving and like the outdoors as much as sitting in front of the idiot box killing time. 

YOU----------

I am no Brad Pitt so I donÃ¢â¬â¢t expect you to be Angelina Jolie either (But I wonÃ¢â¬â¢t complain if you are Ã¢â¬Â¦:-p)

Well, I donÃ¢â¬â¢t really have a checklist but I know that I enjoy the company of ambitious, expressive (be it the shades of vulnerability), upbeat, witty minded people who are willing to change, grow, share and love in their own unique way. (Never understood why one would want to be anyone else when one can be themselves) And as someone once said ""You like someone for their qualities but you love them for their vicesÃ¢â¬? (Did anybody really say that? Or I just made it upÃ¢â¬Â¦)

YOU AND ME---------------

In just one word Ã¢â¬ÅCOMPATIBLEÃ¢â¬? and in so many more------> 

* We talk to each other about everythingÃ¢â¬Â¦.. (You talk and I listen Ã¢â¬Â¦I guess thatÃ¢â¬â¢s how it usually worksÃ¢â¬Â¦).... WARNING I am a big talker (I am sure you have figured that out by now)Ã¢â¬Â¦But I am a very good listener tooÃ¢â¬Â¦. 

* We go out with our friends and have a blast. They are envious because we are a perfect couple.... (Who is the designated driver, You ask? Ok, we take turns :-p)

* We are two ambitious people and support each otherÃ¢â¬â¢s dreams and goals.. Ã¢â¬Â¦We constantly inspire and motivate each otherÃ¢â¬Â¦( This should have been first in the list, but well this is not in any orderÃ¢â¬Â¦)

* We play racquetball, tennis, go for long runs and work out (You yell at me once in a while to get me goingÃ¢â¬Â¦. :-p)

* We visit our families often and love spending time with themÃ¢â¬Â¦.......... (My family loves you and your family loves me even moreÃ¢â¬Â¦. lol)

* We fight for the TV remote every Sunday morningÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â¦You of course win and I go off to kitchen to make you some tea or coffee Ã¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â¦.. (Stop dreaming nowÃ¢â¬Â¦. :-p, We literally fight for that remoteÃ¢â¬Â¦and who so ever loses makes the coffee... )

But he knows how to keep a balance between work and play. Loves nature and urban surroundings alike, always keeps his camera ready, an avid reader, a connoisseur for music and art and is a self proclaimed foodie (cooks great also); always ready to visit places, likes sports, adventure sports...... list is too long, you will come to know when we talk further.

This place might not be enough to know or tell about someone, but certainly sufficient to let our visitors know that what we expect. As parents we want a girl who can compliment his personality, support his enthusiasm and ambitions and contain his energies when needed. She should be beautiful (will be additional advantage if she is pretty also, but not necessary), willing to move to the US or to stay abroad and not to mention fluent with the language of the land. Preferred is a masters/post graduate/graduate in sciences/technologies/management/engineering/applied fields of humanities and such, but is not restrictive. We will be more than happy if she wants to further her education in the US.
We are a nuclear family, I,(Father) worked as a Cost-accountant with a PSU and my wife is Lecturer  of an Intermediate college. I hail from West Bengal (Musrshidabad) and my wife belongs to a renowned family from Eastern UP. You may place us in upper middle class of society.

"Hi penning in about self could be a quite daunting task, Maybe I need to learn the art of eloquent and charming expression. It makes me think of a lot of adjectives with which I would love to describe myself. But if you look at the issue in depth then you will realize that different set of people know us differently.

Nearly all my friends are married with 1children... and cupid seems to have missed my direction. I guess it is time to really consider the next phase in my life and finding the right person to spend with and who can share the good and bad times with ease

IÃ¢â¬â¢m known to be vivacious, cheerful and humorous by my friends and family. Despite this, I handle challenging situations with reason and maturity. I like honesty, sincerity and loyal when it comes to friends and relationship, everyone says I have a good heart and I want to give it to the woman whom I am going to spend the rest of my life. I think many of my friends would sum me up as being a caring and genuine individual someone who has lot to offer to the right person.

I am too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear and too happy to permit the presence of trouble. I give some time to the improvement of myself.  I'm driven by the simple things: good people, good conversation, good energy, though I'm grounded by the big ones: family/friends, a sense of social responsibility and spirituality.    Having a clear mind and good health is the key to living a successful life. I never live in regret. I believe that everything that has happened to me (good and bad) is part of the great plan that GOD has in store for me. It makes me who I am. I appreciate each day of life as it comes. Having had a bad phase, have realized that pain helps one discover latent depths in oneself & have gained insight and maturity as a consequence. I respect people and their opinions. 

I believe tradition and values give us a solid rooting in life, whereas education expands our horizons. Strong family values are at the core of my upbringing, which is balanced by a progressive outlook on life. I believe in respecting and appreciating people's values and tradition, which are different from mine.

My family comprises of my father, mother and two younger brothers and I love them dearly. I also have a fairly small and close knit circle of friends whom I meet often to catch up on recent happenings. 

The way I perceive, Marriage is about nurturing a fragile plant with patience, care and commitment and weeding out differences and ego trivialities and eventually enjoying the fruits of labour; Trust, Togetherness and everlasting Happiness.

"I am very confident and always up to grab a challenge - The word IMPOSSIBLE itself says : I M Possible. So every thing which seems impossible, itself says that is possible (though I do not go for mad challenges :))<br><br>

My Passion : I am particularly interested in computing. I've been with computers since my dad bought me one in 1994. It was initially meant only for fun and games, even I did not realise when this piece of equipment turned into a career for me. But I enjoy my profession, and as said one can perform best in his/her profession if that is his/her hobby as well.

My Work : I work in the network performance team -- the charter of this team is to keep continuously innovating to improve network performance and to keep up with new technology. Presently I am working as Senior Technical Consultant. The company I work for, provides internet access terminals, WiFi hotspots, public and managed payphones and other related services to customers across the UK & Germany. The company is a market leader in the provision of public internet access terminals in the UK.

Career and Ambition : I want to progress further in my field (IT) and want to setup my own business. Currently I am building a project plan and want to incorporate this business in India. I will be visiting India in Dec to see the feasibility of this project and will think to settle in India if this clicks. I am on work permit with the company I work for and my permit expires in 2010, I will be eligible to apply for a permanent residency by that time. But as of now, my vision for settling down in UK is sceptical.

Partner Expectation : Though being in UK for about 4 years I have not forgotten traditional family values, I am looking for a partner / companion who can stand by me through thick and thin. I am a very high risk taker (though my risks are calculative) and I believe in No Risk No Return. I have seen major ups and downs in my life and I want someone who can support me when I am passing through a tough time and vice versa. I am looking for someone who is a blend of traditional and modern values, who understands the difference between the two and prioritise between them as and when required.

Leisure Activities : In my leisure time I like to go for a long drive listening to Indian music. It relaxes me the most. I also like swimming and billiards (if I get time away from my computer :)) but at times I have to find time for myself and push myself for such activities to relax.

Past is Experience! Present is Experiment! Future is Expectation! Use your Experience in your experiment to achieve your expectations!

"[[My History:-]]

I came from a traditional valued Family in Adyar, Chennai. My Ancestral origin is Srikalahasthi [my forefathers lived there!]. I've done my schooling in Montfort Convent and Santhome High School in Chennai. I've done my Engineering Degree in Computer Science in 1998 at Arulmigu Meenatchi Amman College of Engineering, Kanchipuram. I felt the separation from my parents during that period since I've to stay in Hostel. This helped me to stay far away from my Land now!!! 

After I completed by Engineering degree and I got on my first job, my dad expired in Feb 2001. I was very much attached to my relatives/elders at that time. After my dad expired, I've taken responsibility of my family [me and mum]. In 2002, I had troubles in my job [since the software field at that time was uncomfortable]. I was without salary for nearly a year, I faced troubles, problems & issues from relatives due to their Attitude when I was in weak situation. And even my elders were helpless and they too supported them due to their family connections.

Then I got job in Bangalore, India with high salary [after IT field gained existence] in IBM Global Services and took my mum with me [to get far from troubles by relatives] and then I felt free to think of my future & developments. I then came London in Jun 2005 thro LogicaCMG organization and came again London in July 2006 for third time and got a permanent job here for 5 years visa [which I can settle here with UK immigrations rules]. For now, mum likes to visit London in short intervals so am planning to make her come in tourist visa short duration. 

[[My Present:-]]

Am staying alone in a Flat in Manor Park, East London where two South Indian temples [SriMurugan temple and Mahalakshmi temple] and many favorite south Indian restaurants are available! I live alone since I don't want to share my loving electronic gadgets with friends or others [since I don't like careless handling of my loving things!]. My work is now currently based in West London [Hayes near Heathrow]. My work is purely based in London [my dream place to settle!].",36,Naidu,Others,,Private Sector,5ft 6in,othm351888,Hindu

Family background : I belong to an middle class family from Kolkata, with my father having recently retired as AGM, Steel Authority of India Limited and mom is a homemaker. My only sister is married and working with SBI in Kolkata and my brother in law is also a banker with Allahabad Bank. We have our own house in Kolkata as well as Bokaro Steel city.

My friends describe me as: an outgoing, witty, confident and a reliable person. I enjoy adda sessions tremendously, and particularly enjoy discussions, where the topic could be anywhere from the financial meltdown to who is a better author, Ludlum or Le Carre.. Basically I am the person whom you can count upon to go for sudden trips, be it a biking trip to the beaches or the nearest restaurant.

Values: One must be truthful and honest to one's self. As long as you are not ashamed of facing yourself in the mirror, you are okay.. 

Motto in life: Do the best you can, and move on. There is no point in worrying, as it is like a rocking chair, keeps you moving but gets you nowhere.

Hobbies: Reading, discovering new places, cooking, trying different cuisines etc.

Favorite books: I am a voracious reader and love curling up with a book , whenever I can find the time. The Argumentative Indian By Amartya Sen, Banker to the poor by Mohd. Younus, The last lecture by Randy Pausch, Freakonomics, Traders Guns and money, The ascent of money. 

Favorite sports: Football, cricket, badminton. And I like playing the game more than watching them.

"A wanderer on a global scale. I seem to belong everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Growing up on four different continents has left its mark on me (for the better I like to believe). I consider time to be my most precious commodity and I like to do everything I can with it. My friends describe me as a typical libra.

I find use for both sides of my brain with my pursuit of the arts alongside my day job. I love discussing issues that are larger than our own lives and sometimes I even surprise myself at how many levels I can relate to different people. This same spirit of pluralism holds professionally as well for me. After a degree in engineering from Canada, a long stint in technology in the US and an MBA from the University of Chicago, I joined a management consulting firm with the ultimate goal of switching to a career in international development. I am now a step closer to this goal having recently transferred to my firm's Mumbai office. (Hopefully this will also put the wandering on hold for a while). I am drawn to women that are witty and don't take themselves too seriously. A lively conversation is what usually sustains the appeal for me.

I'm described as warm, intelligent, and emotional, by the people who are close to me. 
5'8. 5' in height, fair in complexion, Slim, with an inclination to have good physique, down to earth man with family bred high values & modern outlook. 
To me, life is about growth and evolving, a blend of fun and responsibilityand I seek a fine balance in all respects. 

My entire schooling from class I to XII was from Saint Xaviers; then I graduated with a distinction in Physics, and thereafter MBA in Finance and Marketing and ve been a First Class student throughout. 
Its thanks to education and destiny, I've a career I can enjoy and take pride in: I'm presently working with a leading pvt. sec. Bank as a State Head for Rajasthan with my last assignment being with HSBC at Dubai till Jun09. I have a career span of 9 years which entirely has been in the Banking Industry. 


With career accomplishments on track, I find time for more interest;
I'm a fitness enthusiast and nearly every day begins at 6:30 a. m with an hour of jogging session. Reading is an all-time favorite activity, from Management Gurus to Comic Books (Asterix /TinTin/Chacha Choudhry are few among my favorites) and everything in between. Swimming is an activity I wish to do more often, in summers and on vacations. I like movies which are funny as well as intelligently made. Also fond of playing guitar which has a count of 4 now at my place (earlier 3 were broken.. :-) by me. 

As a family, we've seen ups and downs, and weathered them in the spirit of a team. 
Have seen a tough time of life and relationships recently and finally it has come to an end. We keep our optimism and faith in Almighty alive always. We are closely bonded and stand by each other at all times. 
I believe the best years are ahead;and I'm looking forward...

Hi
I am Deepak and i guess itÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢s finally time to find that special someone so the search is on. About me humm where shall i begin....... Well I am a very independent, practical, honest and a straight forward person. I enjoy traveling and the outdoors; I feel itÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢s a good way to break the monotony of everyday life. I also like to cook at times; I have realized it can be an excellent stress buster. 

My philosophy is simple and I have a strong believe that ""Everything happens for a good reason"" and one should be patience for that good reason to reveal itself in due time though i admit, it can be quite a challenge some time and i am sure we all have had that experience too. 

I was born and raised in India, New Delhi where i did my initial schooling then i was Fed Ex to Australia where i studied business Management, later i shipped myself to US where i worked for premium hotels. Currently i am in Real Estate as a Realtor in Orlando, Florida (Home of the Disney world). 

My life experiences over the number of years overseas had shaped me into an independent self sufficient person. I am a go getter and i work smart hard. I am simple affable, love a laugh dearly I have a great sense of humor too and can cook really well donÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢t believe me well you just got to taste it :-).

"In my own words

Hi,
All Perfect partner Seekers

Well, where does one start to describe oneself! My friends describe me as being confident, fun, and intelactual I can be alternatively goofy and wise depending on the situation. In lots of things I feel am a bunch of contradictions (well, then aren't we all!?)
For example, I am friendly yet shy, rational and emotional... I take my time to open up to people and let them in the inner-circle of friends. I prefer spending time with close friends and family rather than partying.

In terms of hobbies, I enjoy reading, mainly fiction, can range from Calvin & Hobbes, to Hitchhikers Guide to Galaxy to Wuthering Heights! 

Besides this I enjoy traveling and trekking, also like adventure sports (though haven't got a chance to try much of it!) & fitness games 

I have been born and brought up in Kerala; my family is currently based here, though we have most of our relatives in Kerala. 

I have done my Diploma And post diploma from kerala. Also did a couple of computer certification . Currently am working as a Sr. Mechanical Designer in a Project Engineering Pvt Ltd company in Delhi NCR


Regarding partner expectations, I'm looking for someone whose wavelength matches mine; I'm not too much stuck about beauty,eduction,age and financial differences. Marriage is a very important decision and one has to be mentally prepared for it... and I think I'm finally ready for it :). Would appreciate if you send your interest only if you are serious about it.

If you feel our wavelength could match, drop a line and we can take it from there..........

All the best for your perfect partner search! 
Thjanks & Regards

Since I am keen on fitness, I hit the gym regularly. I am trained in combat techniques and martial arts. As a member of the state rifle association, I am trained in fire arms.

Aficionado of Enfield that I am, I have been with a few enthusiasts clubs during my Bombay stint. During long weekends, I get away from the city on my Scorpio. I love to travel and have been around a fair bit. Though I love the outdoors, I do good with a gripping novel at home, if I have to. Having lived alone for many years, I can cook and do a lot of household chores :-)

It is in my nature to be responsible, ambitious and progressive. Generally I am courteous and mild mannered, especially towards needy and elders. There is nothing more I love than a thought provoking debate on social causes. In fact, whenever possible, I attend group discussions.

"Hai 
The fragrance of rain drenching the parched earth, the flash of lightning against an ink-blue sky, the temple bells chiming on festival day... itÃâs these small pleasures in life that make me happy. For me, festivals related to Lord Krishna are very important ÃÂ­ he is our family deity after all. But I respect all religions and faiths. When I am passing by a church, gurudwara or masjid, my hands immediately fold into a Namaste as a mark of reverence. For me all religions are the same and lead to almighty. ItÃâs just that each one professes it in a different way. My soul mate should respect my sentiments. For a relationship to be successful, it must be based on mutual understanding. Just as I donÃât expect my partner to blindly follow my faith, he too should give me the space to follow mine. I am a commercial pilot, based in Mumbai. Though I have been living here for more than 20 years, I would say I am still a villager at heart. I hail form a small village in Punjab. I love cricket, strolling down sarson fields, eating sugarcane and being happy all the time. I am always high on life, thereÃâs never a dull moment. But if there is something bogging me down, I rush to the gurudwara to soak in its sanctity and fell at peace with myself.

My idea of soul mate is not the usual gori-kudi type. She should be a simple, God-fearing person with a golden heart and immense humility. And yes, she should be a great cook, so that we could sometimes offer langer from our home, sweet home. Are you interested?

Well, This is the part that I should tell you something about me....I believe there are a few things in life that any of us has to find out on their own. Same with getting to know each other. But. I tell you something else... Do you believe in love at first sight? Do you believe that for anyone of us true love is out there...? Well I do ...but sometimes we want true love for the rest of our lives... but what about the moment? What about that moment a person looks into your eyes...both feel it. Both know it. And than walk on and never see each other again. But for the rest of your life you will think back of that moment and say WHAT IF.... We all have this perfect love in mind. The ones we see in movies. But think about it...the movie ends after 90 minutes...while you got a lifetime ahead. 

Next to the fact that we all have a different look on love...what might be love to me...may not be love for you... What seems so far might be so close just sometimes we do not see what is right in front of us...and sometimes we do not admit? Why...good question. Afraid to get burned again. Afraid to get a laugh and O... 
So tell me...what is worst...getting a NO or living your life with the question....WHAT IF...... Me...I want to do it all and say it all...but I do not want to leave this world and ask myself...WHAT IF.

My partner should be independent.",36,Brahmin,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",,MNC,5ft 10in,SMM1738972,Hindu
