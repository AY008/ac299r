"About me 
I am a simple ordinary balanced individual .i am presently working as business development manager in a automation and instrumentation company and based at noida.I am looking for a simple ,ordinary , balanced individual as my life partner .The most important attribute i am looking for in my life partner is a good human being above all else.. 
About my family 
my father is a retired diploma civil engineer
my mother is a housewife
my elder sister is a gynacologist(doctor) by profession and is married to a orthopaedic surgeon.
I belong to a ordinary lower middle class family .We could afford to follow a simple ordinary lifestyle .We are not sophisticated in our habits and persona.My mother do all household work like cooking food/washing clothes etc by his own hands(though a maid do work like cleaning utensils etc).My mother only understands Hindi Language (in reading/writing/understanding).My father can read and write English language but can not speak english language.I am also more comfortable in Hindi then in English.Though to a small extent I can also read/write/speak English Language(mostly with errors). All our family members take active interest in tending and rearing a small 300 sq metres garden in our house and we believe in slow pace of life.
About my education 
B.tech(electronics)
About my work  
Currently working us project marketing manager for a 'automation and process instrumentation company'.
Not a very bright career ahead.Very ordinary looking career ahead with low visibility of long term career graph.I am not a very highly qualified professional but at best can be described as semi-professional (mediocre).Previuosly I was in Indian Telecom Service Cadre in Bsnl.Then I switched to private sector thinking grass might be greener here.But now I have realized that I am not so bright and so accepted my likelyhood destiny as a mediocre individual with a ordinary career. 
About my desired partner 
When I myself is not very exceptional and on the top of it I carry a social stigma of being a divorcee,it would be not be fair on my part to desire much(perhaps I do not deserve to desire high)so I would say that somebody who feels good about her innerself,simple ,ordinary and who herself has not much high desires of her spouse (as ordinary person like me would perhaps be faultering in fulfilling her high desires ).I would prefer someone who likes cooking food ; does not dislike washing clothes;work.I would keenly await the expression of interest ,from anyone who would be interested in a ordinary person like me.",41,Jat,"Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India",Other Architecture/ Planning Institute,Others,5ft 10in,muzm1344401,Hindu

"As a twenty-something, I may have heightened the anxiety level of my family members when I decided to set my personal priorities in the early '90s. My marriage certainly didn't figure at the top of the agenda at that time. 

I wanted to go out and explore the world. Conquer the space I would occupy in the months and years ahead. Achieve a certain degree of harmony with my surroundings. Take my decisions at a time of my own choosing. Focus on my professional skill-set. Be of use. Be confident. And be on my own.

I did not do this to scoff at the support structure of the immediate family and the larger clan which was available to me at all points of time. I value it as much now as I did then. I wanted to attain a level of professional recognition and success.

The present decade has brought all of these. God has been kind. Experience of different facets of life has brought maturity and perspective. The paradigm has shifted from the struggle for survival to stability and more success.

Perhaps a few more years have passed in the process of this achievement. Perhaps the probability of finding a life partner at age 36 has relatively diminished. But perhaps other human beings have gone through a similar cycle. 

I am now ready to carve out a shared destiny through marriage. One that will bring mutual joy and happiness. One that will be based on compassion and understanding. One that will kindle love. One that will have longevity.

I have had a happy childhood in Bombay with a family of migrants that came here from west Punjab in 1947. My father studied law at Bombay University and has been practicing it at the Bombay High Court for over 50 years.

My mother is a housewife who, besides me, has raised my elder brother to be a textile professional. It is a different matter that my brother has passionately followed his dream & successfully switched his career to a technology-based occupation.

As a US resident, he now works for a New Jersey-based company and lives in the same state with his wife and two school-going children. My sister-in-law grew up in Bombay and now works for a renowned multi-national travel house in NYC.

After experimenting with my career choice initially, I have settled down as a computer software professional. I am presently employed by a Mumbai-based MNC as a Project Leader.

I have fewer interests because of paucity of time but I am passionate about the ones I have. I love dancing, aerobics, health gigs, music and shopping. I love to have long conversations with friends and family. I love to travel. I have had extended stay in UK, the US, Thailand and Muscat.",41,,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",,MNC,5ft 5in,kannir2605,Sikh

I am simple natured and take the life as it comes. But of course a bold person always ready to solve and come out of any kind of situation. According to me, internal beauty is more important than the physical appearance.
My family members and friends say I am a caring and lovable person. I believes in the truth ---- 'Live and let others live'. I use to spend my leisure time - reading articles/books, watching good movies, listening music, cooking, helping needy peoples and of course doing prayers for all. 
I feel marriage will happen as per the God's wish. It is an alliance of life, a meeting of two souls which is possible only through the full contribution and adjustment from the both to meet and march towards one life time journey. I start searching for my soul mate at this stage of life as I suppose myself to be confident to proceed forward to build a best nest of my coming life.
Family:
From my family front we are three sisters and I am the second one. We all three are working and my eldest sister is happily married. The younger sister still wants to make advancements in her career. My father is a enjoying his retired life at our Dehra Dun home and my mother is a simple and adorable house wife.

I live in a joint family, which includes kids. Strong middle class values, traditional yet modern outlook to life, love of learning and ability to reach out to the needy keeps me grounded. I am not very goal oriented as a person, rather I enjoy the journey of life.

I love travelling, reading, music, cooking, and keeping a good & welcoming household. For my family, I continue to be the holiday planner, chief host cum cook for get-togethers, as well as navigator for weekend short travels!

"Dancing is a perpendicular expression of a horizontal desire. It needs nothing but a cause. No good dancer can dance if he has nothing in his mind. One needs to have a desire if one needs to dance perfectly.
I have always admired the idea of knowing how to dance. That is what motivated me to learn dancing. I got trained for some time and now I can dance without any hitch. Before that, I thought dancing needs to have a lot of dimensions and rules, but after learning it I realized how free and stress-free dancing is. It does not need any fix steps or forms. All it needs is desire to do it. 
Apart from being a Dancer, I am an Accountant and am quite good at my work. I have a very busy life but I take some time off from work and practice dancing whenever I am free. This level of dedication I have inherited from my parents and I am very happy to have them as my idols. 
My family is very close and very well bonded. I get a feeling of belongingness when I am around them. They make me feel I am worthy of a lot of love. 
Apart from that, I love decorating my house and enjoy it immensely. Whenever I am free at home, I start decorating my room. I have helped many friends of mine in decorating their houses.
