"My Friends, Please hold your breath and read the following in BOLD. Here I go...

Life is not all roses as they say.... but at the same time its no way thorns only. So enjoy whatever you can and for whatever you cannot just remember one thing, 'This too shall pass'. This is me, in short.

God knows why I look so serious in photographs. I wish I were more photogenic. So, all said and done, I believe in enjoying all that life has to offer. I like, I value and I understand ('understand'??? Well, it's my belief) what a A True Relationship is. I have a balanced approach towards life and for that matter.. for everything else too.

I like being straighforward and with my friends I am pretty straightforward. Thankfully God has given me such friends who understand me and appreciate and respect me for what I am. It's a bliss.... That's the reason my engeries increase multiple times when I am with my such close friends. Though, I do not claim to give my life away for them, but showing ignorance when a friend is in need is not me, for sure. In my spare time (whatever I get) I surf the net . Also, I love to go for an outing, watch TV, movies, play games and what not(Few of the english movies I like are Dan in Real Life, The Wanted, Jumper & the fairy tale Stardust). Sometimes life will allow me to do all that I want, at other times it won't. So, I have to respect her and agree to what she says. There are so many things about me and I can continue to talk and write about me and my qualities for hours together.. :-) but we have to act mature at times and keep ourselves within sane limits :-) .... at the same time, give a chance to others... So I stop here for 'about myself'. And of course, there is always an opportunity to know more if we are interested... Isn't it?

For me, in life, love, mutual trust and understanding form the foundation for a lasting relationship.. ! Which is what, my quest is here.

Marriage is a one time affair. So, being straighforward again, what am I looking for?.... Ah... I am Looking For... a great friend, nice person, life partner, sweet lady, mature girl and just a beauty, overall. God...!!! I am sure such thing exists...!!!

Take care.... All the best.... !... Amar Jhingan.

About My Self :I belong to Patna. But have completed most of my education outside Patna. Did my schooling from The Scindia School Gwalior, graduation from Allahabad University and finally my MBA from Indian Institute Of Business Management, Patna. Started my career from Patna and my first job was with Reliance Telecom.. After I left Reliance, have been traveling across north India with different companies ( Bajaj Auto, TELCO, ICICI Bank ). Finally got a chance to shift to Pune in 2004. Since then I have been in Pune, presently working as a Zone Head - West ( Sr Manager ) with an Insurance Company. 

What I've Learned from Past Relationship: Flossing is important. Laughing is essential. Perfection is impossible. It's better to understand than to be understood. Laughter can save a relationship; lack of laughter can kill it. Finally, you must expose yourself emotionally -- it's the only way to reap love's greatest rewards. (These are few of my dos and dont's)

Something about my self :- Have a good sense of humor, have a strong willpower and believe in enjoying even the simplest things in life, smart, good to look at, a heart full of love and compassion. A strong believer in karma and hard work. Family is my ultimate strength. I canÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ¢t imagine my life without my family. Traditional yet tolerant to all religions and views. I seek what I can commit and that is honesty, support, love, care and companionship at all times. I am a self made, confident guy, highly impressive personality. Well cultured, good communication skills, widely traveled, very practical, have seen many hardships in life, highly professional n well organized person. Have a passion for outdoor adventurous sports, love to travel, enjoy spending time at home with family, one can say a very lively person in my office and my friend circle and off course in my family too. Oh yes one more thing at times love to cook also. 

I am looking for practical happy and lively girl who will be joy to all. Sweet natured professional girl. A person who would walk with me in each & every phase of life. 

After having gone through one committed relationship, I may be rusty about this courting stuff, but I'm not jaded by divorce. It's even clearer to me that there's not just one person out there. And even if you get lucky and meet a winner, there's a mountain of work ahead, no matter what. It's knowing that the work is worth it, that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, which redeems the institution of marriage. I came to the point that I am longing for a stable love life again. I love having a stable, loving warm relationship where you can trust a person with your most dear secrets. It is impossible to describe here the ideal relationship. love, passion, respect, warmth and aching fears that this bliss might end one day...... It is morning coffees together before work, occasional phone call during the day to make sure you are ok, evening suppers in front of the TV, long hikes when you don\'t say much to each other but silently agree that the world is a beautiful place.... same directions in a long journey of life and mutual understanding that sometimes it is necessary...

"I keep an open mind and experience and try new things whenever I can. When I find something I truly enjoy, I dive into it with a passion and commitment until I see it through to fruition. I am never truly content as I am always looking for new challenges so that I can continue growing and expanding my horizons. 

I am into movies and have a decent collection going. I do not buy just anything. I must really like the movie or it has to have unique qualities about it in order for me to purchase it. When I do, I seek out the best version of it whether it is from North America or Japan. My movies range in taste from:

thoughtful dramas (eg A Beautiful Mind/What Dreams May Come) to

comedies (eg Rat Race) to

pure fantasy (eg The Matrix/Star Wars). 

Depending on the kind of day I have at work, in the evening, I play music that is the opposite of that to keep a balance in my life. For example, if I had a really hard and intense day, I play music by Enigma, Enya, Delerium, Deep Forest, or something else that is mellow and soothing. If I had a really boring day, I play progressive house, trance, or anything else that has a nice beat to it. Unofficially, I have the title of Mood Music Manager at work as I create what I like to call sonic landscapes during the day. 

I may be a techno-geek with all the stuff around me all day long, but I am also a nature lover. I like being outdoors just to feel the ocean breeze on a warm day, to smell the sweet air after the rain, to listen to the birds, to just sit in quiet contemplation. Whenever I can, I watch the kinds of shows they have on Animal Planet or PBS where animals or the outdoors is the focus, or about our surroundings in general including what is beyond our planet. 

Does it look like I enjoy eating? YouÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢ÃâÃÂ¢d guess right! I like to cook and experiment with new recipes when I have time. I like trying foods from different cultures. I guess that is easy in Vancouver since there are so many restaurants of all ethnic origins and diversities. 

When it comes down to it, there is not much I don't like. I certainly HATE people that are rude, crude, insensitive, have no feelings for anyone except for themselves or those who impose their beliefs on others. I have a list of other things, but they would be too petty to mention. 

I am a pretty easy going guy and usually turn the other cheek. In the business that I am in, I have to be. If, however, someone were to push me far enough (and believe me it takes a lot to do that) be warned, I can become just as nasty and then some! 

There is also the silly side of me. I like keeping things light with humour and comedy, but when it comes to something needs to be done which requires all my resources, become focused and intense. 

I am analytical and inquisitive by nature. I want to know how things work, why things are the way they are, and what makes us who we are. 

My biggest fear is not meeting someone elses expectations when I have set out to do something through my own will, or when asked to do so. I rarely say no. Normally, it does not matter what anyone thinks about me, whether you like me, hate me, or are indifferent so long as I have not given reason for you to feel that way. If I have given someone a reason not to like me, I will try whatever I can to correct that. 

I have no expectations of anyone else except for respect and admiration so long as (s)he thinks I have earned it and not because I think I deserve it. 

I do not ask for favours or help from anyone unless, under very rare circumstances, I have exhausted all of my own resources.

After having this long trip to Europe, presently i am teaching as well as working on large scale planning and Urban design projects in India and South Asia. 

My friends told me that i am honest, smart, clever, simple and fun loving person! I believe when you take difficult situation in life with sense of humor then life goes easy. 

I like to see entertaining movies, shows and musicwise like Salsa, Jazz, Rock & Blues. 

Listening to instrumental music in early morning makes my day calm and good. I try to go to swimming every day and i believe its best exercise for body and mind. I like to be part of debate and enjoy philosophical discussions. I think thats the way to develop one's self. 

Marriage is a social institution where each member share responsibility. Without love marriage is meaningless. Understanding each other is the most important aspect for me. By arrangement two people can meet and perhaps by meeting more the flower of love develops in garden of mysterious life. Honesty is the fundamental base for any long term relationship.

"Hello,

As you would have rightly figured out, I am serious in getting married and I will not disappoint you with messing attitudes (and neither will I want such attitude in return, so if you are curious or a time waster, please do not show an interest in me).  So if you are still interested in me (trust me, I am not very photogenic), please can you email me at Harpal73 at live dot co dot uk with your brief description, your clear and recent photo and your phone number and I will promise to call you, and I am sure we can chat and meet mutually (I believe it is important to meet and not to judge by the book cover, then after meeting we can decide accordingly).

Ok so here is a bit about me...

My name is Harpal.  I live in East London in Stratford (where the 2012 Olympic is being organised, as Stratford is quite popular for that to some extent).  I was born in Kenya Mombasa and my parents came to London when I was 2 years old (so I am a British citizen).  My family origin is from Amritsar India.  I am 1973 born making me 36 years old (though some people have said I look younger, hmm nice compliment I guess).  I am 5'9"" in height (175cm) and about 75 kg in weight.  I am of slim/medium build, smart appearance, fair skinned with black hair and brown eyes and when I smile, I have a dimple on my right cheek (hmm I hope that is good to have).  I am clean shaven (not turban). I am of Sikh religion (Ramgarhia caste) though caste does not matter to me, as I feel caste doesn't measure the true compatibility of a person's characteristics.  I have graduated in MBA Business Administration.  I work for the NHS as a Team Coordinator in a London hospital in East London.  I have never been married.  I enjoy martial arts, gym, music, movies, theatres, driving (I have my own car), travelling, going out and socialising.  I am known to be a person who is easy to get along with, caring, loving, romantic (well waiting for the right girl to share this with), honest and friendly.  I am a family orientated person without doubt.  I do not smoke and I do not drink and I prefer to eat vegetarian (just health conscious you can call me).  I do believe in God, but do not have time to go to the temple every day.  I have a slight accent despite the fact I have grown up in London all my life (basically when I was a child, I had a speech impairment which till now has never caused any barrier to my personal life).  I have a good blend of both eastern and western cultures.",40,Ramgariah,Others,,Public Sector,5ft 9in,othm1094589,Sikh

"I am an emergency medicine trainee and the work life could be both exciting n busy. I am looking for a good looking and educated girl who can relocate to United Kingdom and preferably could work. Life has been a roller coaster ride so far n I have started feeling that its the time to get settle down. I have been working hard for a good future. This doesn't mean that I don't see life ahead of my work. I love to cook and throw dinner parties for my Indian and English friends :-) and all sort of leisure activities like cinema, restraunts etc. Being a hardcore Indian I love to play cricket and sometimes enjoy paragliding whenever get time off my work. 
I personally believe motive in life should be beyond 9-5 work and all these normal leisure activities. I myself is a straightforward and soft spoken guy who doesn't get along well with arrogance n rude behaviour. 
I am planning to apply for Permanent residence by the end of this year and hope that the things will work out in right way.
