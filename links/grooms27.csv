"""Love is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake and then subsides. And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion. That is just being ""in love"" which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident. Your mother and I had it, we had roots that grew towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossoms had fallen from our branches we found that we were one tree and not two.""

This talent grew out of my watching my favorite show, Thomas, the Tank Engine, on TV and videos, listening to the great Ringo Starr (the drummer for the Beatles) narrate the stories with his very pleasant and distinctive British accent. Once I learned to read, I read my Thomas books with a British accent as if I were Starr himself. From that time on my mimicking talent continued. In the years since then, I've kept my parents laughing while doing impressions of Elvis Presley, James Earl Jones, Bill Clinton, Sean Connery, and others.

"Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce me because I know myself so well that I do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes. 
I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like countryÃ¢â¬â¢s peace, I like metropolisÃ¢â¬â¢ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hang Zhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh. 
I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote ""Les Miserable"", or like Roman Roland who wrote ""John Christopher"". They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read peopleÃ¢â¬â¢s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.

"I love writing stories, traveling, long drives, walking on the beach, weekend trips, clubbing, night out, Photography, interacting with people, wine and dine, and exploring new things. Life is a great big canvas, and you should throw all the paint on it you can. Let's make a painting of our friendship. ",27,Rajput,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",,,6ft 1in,mumm986154,Hindu
