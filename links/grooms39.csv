"I love to write, but its a daunting task to sum up myself (or anybody, for that matter) in a boxed space! And well, I am not a writer by profession.

The basics about me - I worked till recently for the strategy consulting major Booz Allen Hamilton based out of Chicago. I am currently a senior manager with Wal-Mart in its corporate strategy group. Before leaving for the US for business school, I worked for six years with India's leading automotive manufacturer at Delhi and Kolkata. 

I am cheerful, vibrant; I love life and laughter - a definite optimist. Classmates described me as: Very genuine, intelligent- intellectually and emotionally, honest and considerate about others, has a strong sense of values and is willing to stand up for what he believes in, creative, willing to sacrifice for others, exudes decency, strives to build relationships. Ok, all this sounds extraordinarily pompous, so I will let it be. :-)

But seriously, I am under no illusion of being picture perfect (pun intended). And I would be equally happy to acquaint you with my negatives. The only reason I wrote out the above is to highlight what I would love to see in you. More importantly, I am looking for someone who truly respects herself. Someone who is confident, knows her own mind and yet secure enough to remain kind. I would love it if you radiate a healthy, positive attitude - are someone ready to share a silly joke and a hearty laugh. Like they say - dissimilarities attract, but similarity is the glue that keeps couples together through the rough and tumble of life. 

I do take out time to pursue my passions and have fun! My interests comprise doing pro bono social work, public speaking, reading, cooking, yoga, writing, understanding people and cultures, and a variety of sports. I am enthusiastic about learning dance, and have been regular at the gym for a while now. 

Oh, and I haven't answered the geography question for myself yet. The right person will have a huge say on whether its back to India or the US for me. 

Looking ahead, life seems to hold so much on offer and there is so much more to learn. I am fascinated already by the journey ahead. A path that can become more fulfilling and fun with a soul mate. Would love to hear if you have similar thoughts.

I am passionate about learning, about sharing new ideas, about traveling to new places, about being an independent and empowered man, but I also long to meet a loving companion, to build a family and to share my destiny. I want to love and be loved, to touch and be touched, and to move beyond myself, to share a wonderful life with the right woman. The most important quality should be intelligence. I want to know someone who will be my full partner in living and learning. Yet intelligence must come with compassion and a loving heart. She is also an outdoorswoman who is hooked on pop culture and isn't afraid to cry during sappy movies. For me integrity, self discipline, and diligence are the keys to a healthy life. Life is a journey, it is not a destination. Life is neither easy nor fair. One must be strong minded. I enjoy everyday life, and take responsibility for everything I do. A person must be ready to compromise when seeking a happy marriage. It requires that one take a risk. I have reached the point in my life when I want to take that risk.

"It is a daunting task to sum up oneself (or anybody, for that matter) in a boxed space! The basics about me - I am currently in India having just graduated from a top-tier business school in the US. I am working for the strategy consulting major Booz Allen Hamilton in Chicago. Before leaving for the US,I worked for Maruti Udyog in Dealer Development, Market Strategy and Sales (1996-02, Delhi and Kolkata). 

I am an optimist, a cheerful and vibrant guy - and I love to laugh. I strive to live life to its fullest. During one of my business school courses, classmates described me as: Very genuine, intelligent- intellectually and emotionally, honest but also very considerate about others, has a strong sense of values and is willing to stand up for what he believes in, extremely creative, unselfish, willing to sacrifice for others, flexible and able to accommodate other viewpoints, extremely well-mannered, exudes decency, strives to build relationships and understand others. At this point, I think this list sounds seriously pompous, so I will let it be. :-)

The only reason I wrote out the above list of qualities is to highlight what I would also love to see in my partner. She must be somebody who respects herself. Someone who is confident, yet kind and compassionate. Someone who radiates a healthy, positive attitude and a delicious sense of humour. While dissimilarities attract, research says the similarity between couples is the glue that keeps them together through the rough and tumble of life. 

My interests comprise doing pro bono social work, public speaking, reading, cooking, yoga, writing, understanding people and cultures, and a variety of sports. I have been regular at the gym for a while now. I am on a mission to learn golf during this vacation (ok, that was overstating it :-) - but I am going to take a shot at learning the basics). 

I grew up in a very warm and loving family. As an Army officer's kid, I guess I was exposed to a variety of places, people and experiences during my childhood. My father has since retired as a Brigadier. I have two elder brothers who are officers in the Indian Army and Navy respectively.

I believe it important to keep growing as a person throughout life. I carry a spiritual understanding of human life and of the world we live in. A couple genuinely in love would feel free to truly discover and be their own selves in their marriage. 

At this point in life, if I look back I feel I have travelled quite a distance. But looking ahead, I realize life has so much more to offer and there is so much more to learn. I am sure a fascinating journey lies ahead. It is a journey that each of us can make infinitely richer and more fulfilling with a soul mate and life partner.

I expect my would-be wife to be of that height of my level by means of intellect, talent, knowledge, pure heart, and virtue. I strongly believe and hold this view, and I say these only are the true riches we as parents can pass on to our children and future generation through our genes. I expect the girl (preferably working in govt. or private) who meets all these qualities. 
.... I live an intellectual life, who consider the life without a higher & noble goal to achieve and intellectualism is just waste.... by this, please don't think that, I am under estimating or disrespecting the common people, for whom actually I have a lot of respect which they deserve naturally. What I am trying to emphasize or convince is the animals which are born in the form of HUMAN should live, behave, act and THINK like HUMAN... and must be HUMANE!

I?ve been born and brought up in Mumbai where I spent first 18 years of my life after which I?ve been in different places either for education or work. Though my undergraduate degree was in engineering my interest in design made me pursue two masters in Industrial Design (one in India and the other one in the U. S. ). I worked for a brief period in the U.S.and returned to India in 2010.

My interests in life are quite varied and I enjoy a broad spectrum of things be it different genre of music, movies or books, depending on my mood ? but humor is one thing I always appreciate. I like art in most forms. 

Not a big sports fan but whenever I do watch a game I prefer watching fast paced games like soccer and basket ball and like playing ping- pong/table tennis. 

I love the outdoors and trying new restaurants and different cuisines? love travelling (have travelled a bit in India as well as in the west and a few of road trips in the U. S. ). I?m always open to positive influences in life and always open to try out new things at least once. 

I appreciate genuineness in a person and I'm looking for a person who would be my companion and a friend, an equal partner... who is genuinely warm-hearted, social and has a positive outlook towards life and complements me... and is willing to stay committed through ups and downs in life... 

I feel no one is perfect and all individuals are unique in their own way and what matters in a relationship is the chemistry between the two individuals and how good they are together.

"Beaches, Music & Driving soothe me. A self made individual, I have my own style. Its easy to mistake pride vs arrogance. I am proud to have achieved whatever I have till now in my career and personal life and am also ambitious enough to pursue further. When I say ""ambitious enough"" I mean that for me a thorough work - life balance is very important. 
I am kinda offbeat when I say that weekends see me doing my household chores but that does not stop me from catching up with friends, movies, a long drive or just hanging and chilling out.
Passionate conversations over coffee with my partner, add a little twist of romance & humor, double it up with a good dinner n dance, is something I have been wanting and see myself happy with. Having few friends who I can vouch for I want someone who understands those bonds and treasures them the way I do.
Experiences have helped me evolve into a hearty disposition with a great deal of self assurance and confidence. At the same time it has taught me how important individuality and space is.

I always sees the glass ""Half-Full"" and not ""Half-Empty"". 

I believe strongly in sharing all the responsibilities with my future bride equally and will also give her the space and support she needs to develop her potential fully. 

I am a fair, slim, tall and handsome person according to my parents and friends. I speak Dutch and English fluently  and understand Tamil reasonably well. I also understand & speak German reasonably well.

I have completed my education in Accounting and am employed for several years as an Accounting and Administration professional. I am now pursuing the Dutch MBA qualification (Modern Business Accounting) through evening classes and  expect to complete these studies in 2008. 

My interests are listening to music, cycling, travelling to different countries, attending get-togethers, visiting relatives & historical places in India and watching selected movies & TV programs. I enjoy visiting India for holidays.

Some info about Holland: 

It is possible to take up further studies in Holland in the English language in various disciplines. 

Career opportunities in Holland are very good for Engineers (all branches), IT professionals, Accountants, Finance, Marketing and Customer Service Professionals. 

Career opportunities are also very good for Teachers in International Schools in which the medium of instruction is English. 

Holland is one of the most advanced and internationally oriented countries in Europe. London and Paris can be reached from Amsterdam (capital of Holland) in one hour by a flight. 

Most Indians living in Holland visit India every year to spend time with their relatives. 

Moreover, telephone costs are quite low now-a-days; so one calls one's relatives/friends in India quite often. In addition, one can also make PC to PC and PC to Land-line phone calls worldwide which cost almost nothing. 

There are about 100 Indian families living within 30 kilometres from our house. Hence one can have a good social life with Indians, besides the local Dutch people. 

The working hours in Holland are regulated by law and thus no one works beyond 8 AM to 6 PM for long periods. Only exceptionally, do people work in week-ends as well. Commuting times in Holland are also generally short like 30 minutes or less. Thus, balancing the domestic responsibilities with a professional career is a lot easier in Holland than in India and U. S. A. As a consequence, the overall quality of life is a lot better in Holland than in many western countries.

Moreover, there are a lot of part-time jobs available in Holland in all professions. This also helps to balance the career with domestic responsibilities more easily.

"Hi, We are a Rajasthani Brahmin family. We are looking for a suitable alliance for my brother from an educated & decent girl who is modern in her thoughts but also understands values. My brother is a God fearing, educated, handsome (looks 35-36 years) and a family oriented person. He is very matured and has always shouldered his responsibilities in every way. We lost our parents many years back (Dad in 94 & Mom in 99). I am younger to him. I have done my B-Tech in Computer Systems (from University of British Columbia, Canada) & am residing in Australia with my Husband (working with a Top MNC in Melbourne) & a naughty little son. I requested him to do a write-up about himself and this is what he came up with. Hi, I am an Electrical Engineer with Masters in HR & Marketing. I am presently working as Head - Engineering & Critical Environment, India, for a UK based MNC. I strongly feel that whatever success I have achieved is because of the blessings of my Parents & God.
