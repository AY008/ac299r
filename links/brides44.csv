"hi, 
I am sure most of us would have had difficult time filling in this part of the profile. Anyways, to begin with myself : am a confident, smart, fun-loving & caring person. Am looking for a partner who believes in compatability rather than considering marriage as just a matter of need. So if u r looking for a true companion would like to communicate further. About my education qualification: I am a graduate in Commerce & have always scored rank I throughout. I am also an I. C. W. A. By nature am a very non complicated person who believe in giving space to the other person(basically not the nudging type but possessive for sure). I would admire & appreciate if u r honest even though it may be your bitterest truth. Materialism has never been an attraction for me. I keep away from any sort of family politics & hate to discuss things like: uski saree meri saree se safed (white) kaise!( gesture of jealousy in simple words). I truly believe in myself & always satisfied with whatever (little or more ) is mine. All i look forward is for a companion who is honest in the relationship and who would cherish every moment of togetherness. If u r the kind, can contact else all the best & wish that ur search ends soon!
