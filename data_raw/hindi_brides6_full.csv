"I wonder how a person can be described in just a few words. A human being is such a complex personality that unless you spend some time or live with that person, it is difficult to understand him or her. However, I will try to be as honest as I can be. Unlike other profiles, my daughter don?t claim to be a beautiful, charming or a good-looking girl as she strongly believe that what is attractive to one, may not be the same for another. And then, don?t forget, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Now talking about her interests, she is a voracious reader and writing is a passion for her. It is the way she express herself. She is quite obsessed with Queen?s English and proof of it is that hardly a day passes her without consulting a dictionary five-10 times. Photography also interests and she did a short course but unfortunately could not pursue it further. Most of her time spent in reading, writing and consulting a dictionary, whatever time is left is divided among family and a very few precious friends. She also like spending time and interacting with the aged as she strongly believe that they are storehouses of knowledge. She is much concerned about aged people and look after them very well. She is very discipline and punctual. She like watching good cinema and travelling to new places. At times, she don?t even mind watching soap serials.

"God has selected very few of us to live our lives the way we want to. So many people do not get to live it the way they have desired or planned. I consider myself very lucky to have received this opportunity and that is why I try to make the most of it. I have been the same since childhood. I am very fun loving and try to enjoy every bit of my life. The reason why I do this is because I like to live in the moment and have as much fun as I can and not wait for the next time. Many people who know me appreciate me for this. Professionally, I am a software engineer and love my job the most. I have always been very sincere and hard working and that is how I have been able to reach where I am right now. I have a habit of making the most of all the opportunities I get. In future also I would like to excel in the same field. As a person, I am very sincere and calm. Isincerely do my work and forget about everything else then. This is also a very good thing in me. I was a very sincere student and after schooling, I did BE from Jabalpur. After that, I did MBA from Pune. My father is a retired Senior Manager and my mother is a homemaker. I have two sisters. One of them is married and is a Software Engineer and the other one is a HR in an MNC. I respect my parents and love both my sisters a lot.","The man I get married to should be working in a good company. This is because I like people who earn their own living. They have a confidence that is incomparable to any other person. That is why I would like my partner to be working in a reputed organization. I want to be very specific about one thing that the man I get married to should be from Madhya Pradesh. This is because I want to stay in the same state where I have grown up. Also, I have an idea of the area. Secondly, if I get married in the same state, I can visit my parents whenever I want to without travelling much. He should be family oriented and must spend some time with his family too. This way he will seek a lot of respect from me. He will not only win over me but my family too if he is like that. I am very emotional and get upset when people hurt my feelings. I hope the man I get married to understands that and takes care of this thing. I am sure he will become my personal favorite if he respects my feelings and emotions. He will get all he wants from this relationship. All he needs to do is support me and love me.

"AA?A?Beauty without grace is the hook without the baitAA?A?, this is a well-said thought by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Beauty does not depend on the number of times you visit the parlor. It totally depends on the way of carrying yourself. If you have grace in your body then you are the most beautiful person on earth. I consider myself beautiful because I feel it from inside. I try to remain as graceful as I can and this makes me feel I look good. The other reason why I feel I am beautiful is my heart. I am a very clean-hearted person and I am sure that even if I have wrinkles on my face one day I will still feel I the same as my heart will remain the same. I am an IT Professional but I am not working at the moment because of some reason. I am sure when I start working I will acquire what I have set as my goal. My father is an Executive Engineer and he has always been my inspiration. I feel that whatever I am today is because of my parents. Other than that, I have loads of friends and I like all of them. I trust them completely and most of the times when I am free I hang around with them. My favorite holiday destination is Goa. The reason why I love that place is that I am admired with its beauty. Every element of that place is fascinating to me. Long drives by motor bikes, sea, free attitude of people etc.","Every woman wants to marry a man who is both liberal and protective. I want the same combination for myself too. I want him to trust me with things and not doubt me, and on the other hand, I want him to be very protective about me and feel what is my problem is his too. He needs to know that I am very career oriented and want to be well settled. I want myself to be known because of me and not because of him. He must understand that and should keep away from my decisions that are related to my career. His suggestions are always welcome but I will not accept any sort of pressure from his side. He can feel free to tell me if he finds something unsuitable in me, but he should not keep that to himself. This will create differences between us. Having a healthy relationship all my life is something that I would prefer to over anything else. I will prefer a man who is very smart so that we can both make a wonderful couple. I don't want him to be extraordinarily good looking but he should be pleasant looking. However, his personality is what is important and that should be very interesting. With all these qualities in a man, I will promise to keep him happy forever. All I need from him is a great deal of support and love.",,30 to 32,27 Aug 1981,03:55:00,India,Kanpur,Slim,Athletic,,Agarwal,Agarwal,,,Very Fair ,Fair,Daughter,BE B.Tech (Engineering),"32 yrs, 5ft 6in,<br /> Agarwal, Hindu, Hindi ,<br /> BE B.Tech (Engineering), IT, <br /> India",No,No,Vegetarian With Eggs,Vegetarian With Eggs,"BE B.Tech (Engineering),M.Tech,MBA/PGDM,ME/M.Tech/MS (Engg/Sciences),PGDBM",,,,,,,,No,5ft 6in,5ft 10in to 6ft 2in,Yes,Unspecified Don't wish to specify,, 16 Oct 2013,,Yes,Yes,Never Married,Never Married,,Hindi,"English,Hindi",,IT,Cancer,Hindu,Hindu,,No,No,None,None,,,,http://www.simplymarry.com/matrimonial/bride/ghaf1291214/Hindu/Agarwal/Ruma-Agarwal,,,54 Kgs,more than 56 Kgs

A man that I know is going to be there for me through all the complexities that life puts forward, pleasant and not so pleasant no matter what the consequences. Women have consistently been recognized for their desire and style of communication, for the means of expressing emotions, frustrations, and information exchange. The quality of sincerity is one that can be the foundation of a life long relationship. Commitment is a quality that forsaking all other, you are faithful to your partner in life and life-eternal. The quality of integrity is one that I hold very high on my standards for a man. Each of these proceeding characteristics contributes to a man of desire. The reasoning that I firmly believe this is because I""tmve found my ideal partner in my husband. The definition of sincere is to be free from pretence in behavior or feelings, to be genuine and honest. A man can be compassionate towards his friends or family. Having a man whom you can count on wholeheartedly by his word is irreplaceable. For my partner to risk his life or surrender himself on my behalf would be of complete aspiration. The perfect companion that would be for myself would be a man of sincerity, integrity, compassion, and commitment. The qualities that intrigue me are not of material or superficial possessions, but internal contentment and confidence.",,29 to 34,14 Nov 1982,11:55:00,India,Varanasi,Slim,Average,,Brahmin - Saryuparin,Brahmin,Delhi,,Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Sister,B.Sc (Science),"30 yrs, 5ft 3in,<br /> Brahmin - Saryuparin, Hindu, Hindi ,<br /> B.Sc (Science), Others, <br /> Delhi, India",No,,Doesn't Matter,,Others,,,Doesn't Matter,,,,,No,5ft 3in,5ft 6in to 6ft 1in,Yes,INR 1 lakh to 2 lakhs,, 03 Oct 2013,,Do Not Know,Do Not Know,Never Married,Never Married,,Hindi,Hindi,,Others,,Hindu,Hindu,,Doesn't Matter,,None,None,Doesn't Matter,,,http://www.simplymarry.com/matrimonial/bride/delf1075084/Hindu/Brahmin---Saryuparin/Rashmi-Chaubey,,Liberal,48 Kgs,63 to 80 [Kgs]
