Presently, I am a student and I am pursuing my PhD. I enjoy my research work and am looking forward to a profession compatible with my interest. My main weakness is that I am a straight forward. My mother has retired from CDA and father has retired as a manager from SBI. I also have a lovely sister who is happily married and well settled in her life. I like to socializing with friends. Whenever I get time from my work I like to watch movies, listen to music of my choice and read books.","Like every other girl even I want a man according to my choices with whom I can share even my darkest secrets. He should be a good human being who not only respects me but also respects everyone. I am looking for an understanding and a compatible life partner who has a good sense of humor and who knows how to enjoy even the simple things in life.
He should be a well educated person and must be from the same profession which I am in and must be from Service class. Personally I would prefer a man from Delhi/NCR region. The man who will enter my life should be well qualified and settled in his life. This way my parents will be relieved about my happy and prosperous future. Further, he should come from a good family wherein everyone should be well mannered and must accept me easily. I am ready to give all my love to him if he is like the one I have always desired for.

Many people think that smoking cigarettes and consuming alcohol is cool but I am not one of those people. I dona??t like people who drink and smoke. I feel that these things create nuisance in a family. They also are responsible for deteriorating onea??s health. I am not very proud of one thing in myself which is that I am very emotional and get upset when people try to hurt me. I hope the man I get married to is not like this and would try to understand me.

I have mastered the art of managing events and love organizing parties and stuff. I love pets (have 2 of my own), nature walks, talks and treks. Have traveled extensively to most parts of India, and also a few places abroad and all of the times alone, which has instilled the confidence in me to manage my life under any given circumstance. I love my family and the kind of environment and culture in which I have been brought up, my parents have made me modern but not at the cost their values and ethics.

"The reason why human beings are different from animals is because they are well cultured. This is the basic thing that I look in a person when I meet him. This criterion has always been very successful for me to judge people. I am a very well cultured person myself and that is what I also appreciate in people. I have been the same since childhood. My parents inculcated this in me and I am very thankful to my parents for that. I am sure this will always remain in me because I respect myself for this nature of mine. I am a Business Analyst in an MNC and I like my job. I dona??t crib about my work like many other people do. I would like to continue with my work and grow in the same field but if in future, I have some problems managing my work and my family I can leave working. My mother is a homemaker and my father is the Vice president in a software company. I find my parents the best people on earth and I appreciate their love and affection towards me. I pray to god that they make me efficient enough that I can give them whatever they expect from me. My school life was quiet smooth and after that, I did B tech from Wadia College in Pune. I have a very creative nature and I like doing things that are out of the box. I like to decorate flowers and watch movies.","He should be well settled. This will make him very eligible for me, as settled people do not have the tension and pressure at that level. He will himself feel very relaxed if he is settled. Also, I dona??t want to struggle after marriage and want to live a peaceful life. I am strictly against the habit of smoking cigarettes and consuming alcohol. I think these things just create nuisance in the family. They not only spoil the heath of the people who are consuming it but also harm those who remain close to them. When two people marry each other, they not only have to have a relationship with each other but also with each othera??s families. I hope the man I get married to has a good family so that I can adjust with them and love them like my own family. I am very lovable and caring therefore, I will expect the same from my partner too. This way we can become a very compatible couple. I am sure our relationship will be very strong and long lasting if we reciprocate the good feelings that we have for each other. I respect the idea of a good friend in a husband. I will love it if he becomes a good friend of mine as I will feel more connected to him this way.

"Sometimes neither ones aim nor do ones thoughts show the path of living, it is ones interest, which helps in this. I am an example of that; my hobbies have taken me to a higher place of contentment, in terms of my profession. I am fond of travelling &amp; reading books. This all inspired me to start writing in assistance of Dr. Roy. I express my views in a travel magazine. I write for Incredible India and participate in their international campaigns. For writing articles, I have to fly to Australia, America and other places in India like Bihar. I am into media as I am working with NDTV, a news channel, as a director and a producer. I do believe in full dedication &amp; for this, I was always appreciated for professional dedication and by my friends too. Being in media and journalism, my profession and success has never allowed me to cross any confines. I am deep rooted with Indian culture and its everlasting values. I follow moderate and liberal views imbibed with ethics and tradition. Honesty and integrity, being forthright, outgoing, charming are synonyms of my personality. I am pleasant and charming coupled with some degree of boldness. I am strong enough to tackle different circumstances easily. My smile and friendly nature attracts people around. I am very attached to my family; it is an emotional part of me. They are my strength as well as my weakness. A strong back ground, healthy bonding along with individuality is the power of our family. I welcome friends, close ones, acquaintance even problems with a smile on face.","I am well attached to my family and now want to welcome a new member who is going to be my life partner. The person I aspire should be a man with a friendly nature sharing a loving relation with family, having an emotional attachment with loved ones and with me in near future, as I will be his soul mate. My husband should be sentimental enough to keep everybody happy. As I discussed earlier that my family has a strong financial background, I look forward for the same in my partnerAA?A?s family. I donAA?A?t want them to be the richest of all, just want them to be reasonably well off. He must belong to a respected family too. I attained a good position in my professional side. For sure, his income will not affect my opinion or me but my parents will expect him to be well off. They believe that with this we can escape from any clashes of our self-esteem in near future. Apart from all these things, the foremost thing will be his religion; He must belong to the same religion as mine. Love, care, good understanding, and support are the major elements that are required to strengthen any relation; these are the foundations of healthy bonding, I will hand over all of them from my end and will expect the same in return. Everyone has his own personality &amp; prospects to live life.

"A painter knows how to capture a moment and draw it on a piece of paper in the most beautiful way. I feel that a painter is very lucky because only he can draw his imagination on paper. And I am proud to say that she is a painter and have done many paintings.

When she started painting, she realized that this is true and she can do what she was always fascinated with. she is working in the finance department of an MNC and she enjoy her work a lot. In future, she would like to excel in the same field and I am sure she will achieve what she desire. Though, this does not mean that she is overconfident, but it shows that she is aware of her hard working capability. She look good because people say she has sharp features. Apart from that, she was given the gold award for her performance in her company. They appreciate her work a lot and have told her that a number of times. This boasts her confidence and makes her feel worthy of what she is doing. Though she get very little time to paint because of her busy schedule, but she always make it a point to take out time for painting as this gives her a peace of mind. When she is free, apart from painting, she like to read and watch movies. She also like listening to music. Have a Public School background, Amiable , sweet natured, sharp features, vegetarian , can't cook ""Non-Veg"" meal but have no objection in sharing a same table with non-vegetarians well versed in household affairs.","I want to mention something very specifically that the man I get married to should be from Delhi or NCR. This is because I am well aware of the place and will have no problems in adjusting. Also, my parents live in the same city, so I can meet them if I miss them without travelling a lot. I want to marry a man who is very adjustable and flexible in nature. This is because I donAa?a?t want him to dominate me every time. He should be ready to change himself at times too. I am carrier oriented so I do not want him to ask me to sacrifice my carrier. This will make me very uncomfortable as I love my work and I am appreciated for doing it perfectly. I am sure once he understands me, he will be very proud of the fact that I am good at my work. I have many friends and they all are very close to me. I donAa?a?t want my partner to have a problem with that as I will like to continue my relationship with them. I am sure ones he spends time with them, he will not mind me hanging around with them. I have a traditional outlook towards life, although I donAa?a?t mind accepting some of the modern values. My partner can be either traditional with modern outlook. I have no reservations for that.

I can't live with a person who is modern outside and orthodox from inside. Sorry people if you are something like this or living in family like this. We are two different streams in two opposite directions. Mamma's baby also excuse me please. You are mature enough and still you can not go without your mamma in life, please excuse me. For me respecting elders and follow them blindly are two different things. I also live in a family and a society and know how to respect elders and love youngers. I also love my family a lot, respect them a lot but i have my own personality too and expect my partner to be same with his own personality and views. He must be mature enough who can judge what is wrong or right and take is decision on his own. I just can't be artificial. what's in my heart, one can find easily if he/she knows me. I believe in live life as it comes. I believe in today and dont believe in regreting for past. I am very sensitive, caring and a lil bit naughty, talkative girl. I have done B. Sc. in home science. My hobbies are 3Ms (Masti, Movies and Music). Although i like travelling, reading, chatting with friends, cooking also. But let me make a thing very much clear that i just hate fake people and those who don't fulfill their commitment.... so that's enough about me for now, so u think we are like mind contact me. There is a lot more to know about me. But as this is not a social networking site, we all are here for some serious purpose so if you are serious enough then only contact me.","My partner should be my friend. And not a mamma's baby please. Should be mature, intelligent and strong enough to take his own decisions. I want to walk with my partner on his side, i just dont want to follow him or want him to follow me. Life is not very serious or bore or long if we have time to laugh so having a good sense of humor is not bad.

"A religious person always feels connected to God. He gets to talk or converse with him whenever he wants to. I know this because I am very religious and know what it feels like when you believe a lot in him. I have always been like this. My parents taught me the importance of believing in God and worshipping him as well as thanking him for all that he has given us. That is when I realized how happy I feel after praying. Therefore, I have always been praying to God and will keep doing this till I am alive. I am a Software Professional in Infosys. I like my work and enjoy doing it. I want to excel in the same field in future. I am sure I will be able to do it as I am very dedicated towards my work. My school education was very smooth. After schooling, I completed B tech from UPTU, and did diploma from CDAC in Pune. I always paid attention in class and towards my teachers and that is how I am aware of things. My father is a senior Manager and my mother is a homemaker. My brother is pursuing M.COM. Apart from that, I have many friends. My family and friends are very important for me. I can do anything for them and I am sure if I need them someday, they will be there for me. When I am free, I like listening to music and reading book. I also like to watch movies.","I want my partner to be either a business man or a Software Professional. This is because I find business men very charming and interesting. Being an owner is always a very fascinating thing and I like people who have the power to own things. If he is a Software Professional then it will be a good thing, as we will have a very important thing in common, and will also be able to interact as well as discuss many things related to it. It will be easier for us to understand each otherAA?A?s work and also to sort out issues whenever we face any problems at work. He should be from a very good family. This is because when two people get married they not only get to live with each other but also with their families. I can adjust with his family only when his family accepts me as I am and loves me. He should be a very pure person. He should be a non-smoker and should not consume alcohol. The reason why I hate all this is because they create a lot of nuisance and people who consume all this are least concerned about their health. He should be very helpful, not only emotionally, but should also assist me in household work. I know Indian men consider it as a disgrace but I donAA?A?t want my partner to be like this. He should also be concerned about the family and not leave all the responsibility on my shoulders. I am sure if he is what I expect him to be, I will give him all that he needs from his wife.

I am a Simple yet Modern girl working as an Assistant Professor in an engineering college. Looking for a compatible match. Caste no Bar.,"In my view, three characteristics are essential for a marriage partner. First and foremost, compatibility is very important because spending time for the rest of your life with someone is a huge commitment and without compatibility in values, interests and goals, it would be a struggle rather than a partnership. Besides, maturity is also an important factor for being a good partner. I don't want to hang out with someone who is childish and cannot take care of one's self. At my age, it's time to consider a long-term relationship, which requires not only love and affection but also responsibility and care. Moreover, a partner should be open-minded. Being a couple doesn't mean that we have to agree in everything.

"Hello!!! Thanx for stopping by......................... Before I really start I would like to tell u that i m not just looking for the person to get married but i m looking for ""The Man of My Life; My Better Half; My Soul Mate "" as per me an individual is incomplete without his/her better half. This is soooooooooooo difficult but let me give it a try to write about myself............................. Well, I belong to a town called Moradabad(U. P) but residing in Faridabad along with parents for past 4years. I am an extrovert, who likes to have fun &amp; at the same time lead a balanced life of being responsible towards my duties &amp; roles of life. My friends &amp; family would call me a trustworthy, sweet natured, responsible, fun loving &amp; a balanced girl.... they all like me.. In my education I have done pretty well. I am M. Phil in English and also an M. Ed. Though basically I was a medical student and also cracked the PMT at All India Level in 1999 in first attempt but my destiny was holding something else for me. I strongly believe in destiny ......... I believe that it takes respect, understanding, space, love, and above all real communication to make a relationship sail smoothly throughout ur life A&#65533;AAs LIFE IS A ROLLER COASTER RIDE so of course there r ups &amp; downs in life which can be handled if both the partners are understanding towards each other. Therefore, I am looking for the one who is not only good looking.. in a way presentable, good to talk to, with whom I can share every moment of life with ease.. especially the silent ones.. I am looking for the one who is open minded and respects others point of view, is loving, caring, understanding, established &amp; self made man... I respect family values &amp; traditions (though I am very moderate in my thinking).. so expect the same from the one I am looking for...... Well......... this might take long so I leave a lot for when we get in touch........ For now........... thank you for taking out time to read through and wish u all the best in your search for ur better half !!!",We are looking for a well qualified boy with a down to earth nature from a Decent and Educated family background.

"Enjoying life is a very important aspect. Being happy makes people very lovable. It makes them very attractive and people want to hang out with them always. Not because they are cool but because in todayAA?A?s scenario anyone can make people sad but very few can make them happy. I am one of those people who believe in being and making people happy. People who know me appreciate my nature. I not only make myself but others also happy. This according to me is the reason why I am self made and so successful. I am a Senior Process Associate in an MNC. I like my job and find it very interesting. I wish to work in the same field in future too and have success in it. I am sure I will be able to achieve whatever I want to as I am very hard working and dedicated as far as my work is concerned. After schooling, I did graduation in B Com from Allahabad University. Then I did post graduation in MBA from NIMT. I have always been a very sincere student and I wish to remain the same as a person too. My father is an Advocate in high court and my brother is working in Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation. His wife is a homemaker. I have every one but my family became incomplete when I lost my mother. She was an integral part of our life and we miss her now. In leisure time, I like listening to music and watch movies. I like going on long drives and I also like travelling.","As I mentioned above, I am very fun loving and jovial. Therefore, I would like my partner to be the same. I am aware of the fact that people who are like each other tend to get along well. I am sure we will gel up well if he is fun loving and jovial. I am very open to all the cultures and have no problems if he is modern or traditional. The only thing that will matter is his educational background. He has to be in a good profession, as I will appreciate that a lot. Being a woman, I want my partner to be very protective and loving. This will make him very important for me and will give him a very respectable place in my mind. Apart from that, I donAA?A?t want him to be a sadist and he should be very cheerful and jovial. The man I get married to must not have any bad habits. This can affect our married life and can cause many problems in future. He can be from any profession, as I donAA?A?t have any reservations about that as long as he is in a respectable position and in a recognized company.

"True to my name, I am a very soft-spoken, calm and down-to-earth girl. I like to quietly observe people and their behavior. Nevertheless, I equally enjoy talking with friends and acquaintances. I have always stayed in a big joint family and have therefore imbibed the invaluable qualities of adaptability, patience and care for others. I firmly believe in working hard to attain personal and professional growth. I have ventured into two business activities on the Internet. I started a content writing firm with my sister. We write English content for websites, articles, blogs and other media. We have worked with various industries including healthcare, Information Technology, Real Estate- townships, hotels and others. I have also been actively involved in organizing and taking multi-media-rich online classes for the last two and a half years. By now I have taught innumerable students across the globe from various locations like India, USA, UK, Italy, France and others. My students admire my dedication and clarity with which I explain concepts in a simplified manner. I teach Management subjects and English Speaking as well as Verbal Ability for various competitive exams like CAT, GRE, IELTS and TOEFL-iBT. My online tests, classes and content have been accessed by more than 15000 learners all over the world. The good part about my work is that it is flexible in terms of timings and place. I can also attend to my family while working from home. About my family, I live in a close-knit joint family. My father, uncle and brother are in the same business of manufacturing fasteners. My mother and aunt are housewives. My grandmother also stays with us.

"I introduce myself as a person who is simple and sober in nature as well as in thoughts and actions. My life is all about living simply and giving respect to the elders. Further, I am a true worshipper of god and never lose my faith towards him in any situation. I am very creative in nature and try to come up with innovative and unique ideas. In addition to this, I am friendly and make people comfortable with me. Presently I am working as a teacher in a school and I am happy with my work as it has brought a lot of respect and appreciation in my life. I am very passionate about my work and do it with full dedication and commitment.
Family plays a very important role in the development of a person. They teach us to judge good or bad things in life. They also teach us different aspects of life including valuing our relations and being loving and caring towards others. My mother is a homemaker and father is no more. I have two sisters who are married and happy in their new world. Education is very eminent for an individual as it brings success in life and opens the doors of career opportunities. I have done BA from the Delhi University.
Reading books is my best way to spend my time as it takes me to another world. Further, when I am free I like to listen to my favorite music and watch movies. In addition to this, travelling is also one of my favorite hobbies. By travelling I get to know about the rich culture of different places. In my life very few people are close to my heart and among them are my friends. They are the only people after my family who are always there to help me and support me. Though I have very few friends but they are very important to me.","I have always desired for the man of my life as a simple and decent person and not among those individuals who are selfish and self obsessed. Therefore, I am looking for a life partner who is simple and decent. My life partner can be from any profession, I have no issues regarding that factor. The only thing that I expect from him is to be well settled as it is a major concern for my family as well. Being settled reduces the complexities and problems of life which the couples generally face after the marriage. I would prefer a man from the Delhi/NCR region. He should be well qualified and must be from a decent family background. The family must be renowned in the society for their good deeds. This way my family will be contended about my happy future ahead. Family and the eldera??s people of our life play a very important role in our life as without their blessings we cannot flourish and be happy. So I want my husband to be very respectful towards elders and my family members. In return he will also seek respect and love from my side towards his family.

"I describe myself as a simple and friendly person with a very cheerful nature. I cannot see anyone sad so I always try and make other people happy. My jovial nature is enjoyed by everyone and they really like my company. I easily get along with people and adapt myself in any situation. Presently I am working as a corporate planner in Unilever, London. In the upcoming time I want to see myself as a successful person and want to make my parents feel proud of me. Every day I work hard with an aim to attain a reputable position in my profession. My weakness is that I am very emotional. And my strengths are that I can easily adapt myself according to the situations and I am also a family oriented girl.
I am a homely person and always stay close to my family as I really respect and love them. They are my real support and without them I cannot even think of living my life. My family includes a lovely mother who is a homemaker and has sacrificed a lot for us and a responsible father who has taken retirement from his profession. In addition to this, I have a sister who is a doctor by profession. I was a good student of my school and performed well in my class. I have also received many complements from my teachers for this. After completing my school I did PGDBM from Narsimunji, Mumbai.
Friends are always there for us as they laugh with us in our happy times and become one of our biggest supports when we are sad. In my free time I meet up my friends and watch movies with them. I event go to visit different destinations with them. Listening to music refreshes me and gives me time for myself therefore I also love to listen to music.",Marriage is one of the most beautiful relations of all. If you always have your partner with you at all times of joy and sorrow then it is a divine blessing of god. I want a person in my life that is simple and decent in nature as well as in his thoughts.

I just want him to be well settled so that after marriage we dona??t struggle to fulfill the basic necessities of our life.

"A Libran born at 12.30 pm on 28th September, 1980, in a Brahmin family in Bhagalpur. We belong to ""Bhardwaj Gotraa"". I am 5.3 tall and weigh 50 kg. My early childhood was spent in Assam. Schooling in St. Stephens, Tinsukia, SSPM Chiplun and Bhawans School, Bharuch. Graduation took me to BMCC; Pune where I did commerce and then further pursued Post Graduation Diploma in Management from IIMM [2003]. First job and financial freedom came with Tata Infomedia where I worked for about a year. Better career prospects made me shift to ICICI Prudential where I spent four years making my way to Sales Manager. Next jump and promotion came with my joining Bajaj Allianz in October, '08. This is a challenging job and my responsibility as Regional Manager spans across the country with base in Mumbai. I do travel to various cities at least twice a month. I quite enjoy my present job but would like to be in the financial sector in the years ahead. My total financial remunerations adds to six digit in a year. Though working in Mumbai is hectic I do find time to indulge in weekend outing with family and long long drives. Reading preference is eclectic, inspirational and self motivating text being the current flavor. Good movies, music, both film and Indian classical is top on my activity list. Games, adventure sports and travel to exotic places is on my wish list. I value my family and am proud of our culture and traditions. Firmly believe in marriage and permanent relationships, and would happily give away all for a happy home and family. Natural surrounding, company of people with substance and indulgence in activities where I can contribute as a person is what I cherish and long for. My family consists of my parents and one sister and a brother. Sister is elder, engaged and working as a HR Manager in Patni Computers. Younger brother, a management post graduate has started his career with Ballarpur Industries, Delhi. My father is a Chartered Accountant and is with Indorama Cements, Mumbai. His earlier jobs took us to Assam, Orissa, Gujarat and finally Maharashtra, where we now have a permanent base in Panvel [Mumbai]. Our ancestral home is in Rajasthan, though my grand parents lived in Bhagalpur. My mother's family is mostly settled in Assam. My mother is our anchor and support and maintains a cozy, warm and loving home.","I am looking for a life partner. A man of compassion and caliber. One who is skilled and able to steer our ship through choppy waters and adventures enough to explore newer horizons.

"Simplicity is one thing that is appreciated by all. One who is simple feels everything around him is simple. Complexity is tough to handle for them. I am one of those people who cannot handle complexity. Simplicity is always the best according to me. Apart from being simple, I am jovial and fun loving too. I think that ita??s a wrong concept to believe that people who are simple dona??t know how to have fun because I am myself a very simple person and I am fun loving too. My idea of having fun is different from other people because for me having fun is never botheration for other people. I am a Finance professional and I am working in a top financial company in Mumbai. I feel proud of myself that I have reached this position and I think that ita??s due to the inspiration that I have got from other people that has helped me in reaching to where I am today. I would like to excel in the same field in future also. After completing schooling and graduation, I did post graduation in MBA from University of Australia. My mother is a homemaker and my father is a Businessman. I have one sister and she is settled in US. I love my family and I feel that they are like my backbone. As a body cannot stand without a backbone, similarly it is difficult for me to survive without my family. I have many friends and they all are very close to me. They not only keep me emotionally involved but also give me a lot of support when I need it.","No matter how much a person stays away from its culture their culture is always important for them. I want to marry the same kind of a man. I want him to know the Indian culture and he must understand it well. Then only can we get along well. He should be broad minded. This is because I dona??t like men who themselves like to do certain thing but they will get very upset if their wife does that too. I want him to give me all the space I need or else it will get difficult for us to adjust. He should be well settled in whatever career he is in as that will make him very eligible for not only me but for my family too. I am sure they will not get much worried in marrying me to a man who is settled. I am very good at creating a balance between personal and professional life. I hope he is also the same. I can take care of the household and family if he is there to support me and help me with it. This way he can work as much as he wants without avoiding his work and neglecting our family. I am sure if he is what I expect him to be, he will get all that he needs in his life from my side.
