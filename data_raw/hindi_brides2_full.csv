"Patience and calmness is the best quality in a person which can take him to great heights in his professional as well as personal life. This quality is respected the most in people. I am calm and patient as a person. This nature of mine has always been appreciated by my family and friends and others who know or work with me. I am a student currently and I am pursuing my MBBS from Ram Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Science, Bareilly. I am very sincere towards my studies and work very hard to be good at what I am doing. I have many friends and I like spending time with them. They keep me emotionally involved and more than that, they give me a lot of mental support, which is important to have for any individual. In leisure time, I like to read books and listen to music. I also like to travel when I take a break from studies.","I dona??t mind marrying a man from any profession but I will prefer a Doctor or a person from the Officer Grade. This is because I am myself pursuing the same profession and it is good for a couple to be in the same profession. They get along well and have lots to talk about. He should be well qualified and well settled. This is because I dona??t want to struggle after marriage and want to spend a peaceful life without any worries. This can only happen if he has a settled job. Also a settled job gives a man a stable mindset.
His family should be well reputed in the society because my parents will appreciate it if my partner is from a strong and a clean family background. This is not only important to my family but to me as well. I am sure they will be very satisfied if they get what they desire
I am a modern person but I dona??t mind following traditional values. Therefore, the man I get married to can be either a modern person or can have a traditional outlook towards life. I mind none. I am sure with all these qualities in a man I can give him a wonderful life ahead without any worries. ",My mother is a homemaker and my father is a Business man. I have three sisters.
