"Its always been a tough job when we are asked to introduce ourselves cos we know so very well about us and its not that easy to describe us in words for we do not know where to start from. Well when its a must I wanted to give a try so that I may be successful in presenting myself and giving you an idea of who am I. I hope that my try gives you an impression about myself and wish it's not so different from what you have understood. I am the kind of person who is known for Positive Attitude and for my positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, many places I wish to see, I love nature and I wish to spend a rainy day in a hilly region. I can't take too much cold but I wish to play in the snowfall, I love music and I wish to sing along the melodies. I like to learn and to experience. I like to be alone in my room but little scared to be alone in the house, I like birds and animals and I love to watch them. I am very scared of Lizards and I get on to my nerves when I see them in my house. I am pretty organized and wish to the things to be its place. I can?t tolerate untidiness and I like to have hygiene food. I like to cook and I like delicious food.

I always make everyone to be happy around me.","I believe that our life partner should be of our own image as we look it in mirror, so if we are nasty and cruel and never understanding kind of person we get the same kind of behavior or similar behavior from our partner, but if we are loving, caring and understanding we will get tonnes of love and care from our partner. So i have no high expectations from my partner, reciprocate to what i am giving that's more than enough for me. If still want to have a clue then I would prefer a partner who understands family values and relationships. True from heart and committed to marriage. And would be more interested in the one who is straight forward, Faithful besides being very loving and jovial.","To be a part of a family like mine is so divine where love is shown hurt is shared. our love for each other is never impaired. we talk we laugh we cry but we are a family and we do it all together for as a family, we do it all as one.

"Hi To begin with, i would like to say that i basically belive, to live and let live others, i like indian culture and our value system especially. the close bonding that we share with our family, here i would like to state that i am blessed to have one such family. My family comprises of Dad, a Central Government Employee, Younger Bro who finished his B. E. and is working &amp; my dad's eldest sis, i. e. my aunt. I lost my mom when i was quite young. I am very attached to my family. My brother being my best critic and i owe all my success to my aunt and dad. I am very expressive and direct, very sensitive &amp; glad that i am this way, as i am usually liked by everyone for this ( I owe this to my Psychology degree). I tend to give a lot of importance to emotions and the need to express them, i personally feel this was present in the indian culture but we are losing now as all of us are hard pressed for time and getting materialistic. I am very matured by my thinking and prefer others also to be this way.
Oh ya... i am ambitious but not at the cost of losing a family.... so i am highly family based. So i balance between my career and family and expect my man to do the same. I am currently doing my Ph. D in management.
Looking out for a person who is also equally sensitive and expressive of emotions, who tends to value the importance of others emotions even if he does not necessarily agree with it. He should be sensibile and oriented to the needs of family, should be achievement oriented but have the morals not to stamp on to others shoes to be successful. It would be great if he too has a blend of likingness for Indian culture and traditions and the modern views.
I would expect him to move into my family and be a part of my family and not just in my life, i vow to be the same towards him. I basically aim at two families getting together and not just two individuals.
I have a mental block towards alcohol and smoking so prefer my man not have those habits.","Looking out for a person who is also equally sensitive and expressive of emotions, who tends to value the importance of others emotions even if he does not necessarily agree with it.

I've had my schooling from prestigious schools in New Delhi, followed by B.E (Comp. Sc. Engg. ) with Distinction from Pune University. I'm pretty ambitious,and a solid go-getter, but since I like having my cake and eating it too, I try and maintain that elusive work-life balance. I grew up in Delhi, and have also lived extensively in Pune and Bangalore, before zeroing in on the wonderful, enterprising, chaotic, melting-pot of a metropolis that is Mumbai. I'm passionate about travel, literature, music, the feminist/humanist cause, yoga and nature. I'm a history buff, a feminist and a classical music enthusiast. I like theater, old films, world cinema and while I love my own company too, I suppose I could be called an extrovert as I also like meeting and engaging with like-minded passionate people. I also love exploring different cultures and places around the world and in India.. a sort of female Indiana Jones, if you will. I'm looking for a suitable, intellectual, well-educated, cultured person from a similar family upbringing, background &amp; position. Looking for adventurous souls who are liberal, feminist, spiritual, devoid of ANY gender bias, and are blessed with a great sense of humor. Vegetarianism and being a non-smoker are key preferences.","We are looking for a suitable, well-educated, cultured person from a similar family upbringing, background &amp; position. A well-traveled person brought up with liberal ideas and thoughts, a strong sense of ethics, a spirit of kindness and an interest in giving back to society, with an ability to relate to people well. A great sense of humor, varied interests and hobbies, a keen interest in different cultures &amp; places, a broad-minded, independent, non-chauvinistic nature, and a cheerful disposition rounds off the ""list"". I usually get along best with creative, spiritual, intellectual, passionate, driven people, ideally interested in classical music, old temples, theater, art and good literature (that's how I spend most of my free time, hence I'd prefer someone whose interests match mine, else there wouldn't be any ""us"" time at all). Oh, and those who've grown up devouring the adventures of Bertram Wooster, Captain Haddock and folks from a certain Gaulish village usually end up being kindred spirits. Finally, vegetarianism, being a non-smoker, and being a feminist/devoid of all gender-bias, are must-haves. ","We come from a very well-placed, highly-educated family of senior-management PSU executives, and senior bureaucrats (IAS /IES) in the central government at New Delhi. My dad - an engineer from IIT-Madras, retired as a senior executive from a central PSU, New Delhi. Mom -a very well-known exponent of Indian classical music (the veena).

A nature lover, I love taking trips to the mountains and enjoy trekking. I believe in optimism and feel that it can conquer all odds in life! I am spiritually inclined and do not believe much in showy and loud religious practices, unless I can see a valid reason behind such a practice.
As for the academics, I did my Masters in Statistics and am into a career in analysis since 2008. I have also been performing Carnatic Music on the concert stage since 2003. Carnatic music is the essence of my life, and I aim at a career in performance of the same.
I live in a small joint family consisting of me, my parents, my grandmother and my bachelor-uncle. My family is influenced by traditional values, but at the same time has a modern outlook. We do not believe in superstitions and always try to look for a scientific reason behind them. My parents are nature lovers too, and we have fun travelling, doing crosswords, discussing spirituality, astronomy, music, science and almost anything else!!","I am looking for an understanding and cultured person who enjoys Carnatic music, and is based in Bangalore.

"Dear All, My parents have given me the privilege to jot some notes on myself to help you to get some traces of me and not completely me. Understanding about someone can never be accomplished fully, so kindly do not try to draw any conclusion about a person out of his/her profile. My ambitions, my memories, my learnings, my interests, my thoughts, my good deeds etc cannot be filled in here. This is just a glimpse for you to know me.... My parents have provoked the traditional practices in me, but have also taught me to accept every good that could value me, so I am not conventional; I believe that all gods are one. But I am too much fond of Lord Muruga. People find me as a fun lover and everyone loves to chat with me. That's because, I am a good listener and I intend to reciprocate in their own language which usually cherishes them. I always try to explore and create my own lovely world, where I have also learnt to enjoy from my loneliness and I prefer it sometimes. I do have my playful side, where my family members can opt to cherish them (or) to become my teacher. I love to chat with my mom. Sometimes, she shares the same cute story again and again, but it still interests me. I always cherish her love and innocence. I love to pull my brothers leg and we have been always very supportive to each other at all circumstances. My father is equally a fun loving person, but yet known for his confidence. My interest has always revolved around my family and my career. However, I love to travel &amp; explore the other side of the world, but had very few travels so far. I love to learn new cultures, languages, watch movies (no matter, what language they are), listen to music, reading books, writings, creative and out of the box stuffs etc. I certainly love to have some intelligent conversation with my better half. I love to enjoy each &amp; every moment calmly and cherish it in my own way. I love nature, the god's best gift. I believe that, the journey of life tend to change and bring new interests in us... So, nobody's list can be exhaustive. I have completed my masters in management of business administration and had a fruitful professional learnings with considerable years of experience in MNC. Have been a top performer in my organisation and had an opportunity to serve in several domains with the top management team. I recently decided to choose for a break to get relieved from tedium and to invest my time to travel around my aspiration. I am keen to attain some heights in my education even after my marriage. There is definitely lots to share about my interests and ambitions in my profession / education. Nobody is perfect, so I should have my limitations too. When they are pointed out, I always try to analyze it myself to find a justification, then I work on it. Anything more than this about me will be too much at this moment. So, signing off with my best wishes for you to get your soul mate In case, if my profile interests you, then we would like to begin initially with exchanging of photographs and horoscope (if not available in the website) and then the families to contact each other to understand the backgrounds and go for the horoscope match. In case of willingness of both the families to move forward, then a formal meeting between the families, where the prospective boy and the girl can communicate with each other to know their compatibility and ultimately allow them to make the final decision. In case, if the groom is located outside india, then would like to entertain a net / voice chat session for an agreed time frame. Grooms with following stars kindly excuse my profile: Visakam, Uthiram, Poorathadi, Karthigai, Chithirai, Uthiraadam and Punarpoosan. The photographs uploaded on this site are my recent photographs. The contact number listed here belongs to my parents, who will be more willing to support you with all the information about me and my family.... Have a cheerful day... Jeevi","An explorer in his profession with a decent salary package. He should be understanding and adjustable, who knows to live for his family. An honorable person, a trusted friend, a motivator and a noble teacher to his family, who also have the willingness to learn. He should share his moments and should be willing to understand mine. Talk &amp; listen more. He should cherish each moment of life along with me. Travel the ups and downs of the life journey confidently and politely. Who knows to live the moments honestly.
