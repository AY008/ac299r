"A poet knows how to capture a moment and present it in the most beautiful way to people. I feel this is the most beautiful asset one can have. I feel I am very lucky to have an asset like that, as I can express what I feel through this. Since childhood, I was very fond of writing poetry. I wrote many of them and still have them with me. So many people around me love to read them and often praise my talent. Whenever I feel something odd about any situation, I write poetry if I can and I feel better. It makes me feel good about myself that at least I have a different perspective about certain things. I am very friendly as a person and have many friends who are very close to my heart. I like hanging around with them and I am sure I will be there for them if they need me. I have a very normal and moderate outlook towards things. My family is well settled and we are very close to each other. I try to spend as much time as I can with them and I donAA?A?t feel bored when I am around them. In fact spending time with my family is like a treat to me, as I can be myself when I am around them. I am not working at the moment but wish to become a scientist or a lecturer when I work. I am well qualified and I am sure I will be a very successful professional.","As I mentioned I am very career oriented and therefore I wish to do something exceptionally good in future. I want my partner to have no problems with that. He should be well qualified and must respect my work and this way even I can respect his. I want someone who matches my nature and this way he can understand me well. This will make us more compatible and friendly which will make us a better couple. Apart from that, he should be very well behaved, as I will appreciate that in my future family. They should be vegetarians as this is very important for me. They should not be greedy as I will not be very comfortable with that. I want my future family to be very subtle. The man I get married to must not have any bad habits. This can affect our married life and can cause many problems in future. He can be from any profession, as I donAA?A?t have any reservations for that. I am sure if I get the man I have dreamt of, I can assure him a lot of happiness in future. He can live his life the way he wants to and let me live it the way I want to.

This is because I belong to the same family. My life was always different from others and I am sure I want something different in future too. He should be very good to me but should not be sympathetic with me as I am myself not sympathetic with myself. I love dancing and want to continue dancing in future too. I hope he does not mind that and I am sure that if he realizes I am good he will be very proud of me. I want him to be very liberal with me, as I like to have some space.

"Independence is one of the things in life that makes a person feel he can do everything on his own and nothing is impossible. I also feel the same and now I dona??t want to depend on other people to get what I want. Many people are not able to experience it but I feel wonderful to have achieved my independence. Many people admire me for being like this and I myself also appreciate this in other people. According to me, this feeling is very important in people, especially girls. Professionally, I am a Development Officer in LIC. I like my job and enjoy every bit of it. I always take up every opportunity I get and that is what has brought me this far. In future, I would like to stick to this field and grow in it. My mother is a homemaker and my father is working in ONGC as DGM. My Sister is studying SAP from Ahmadabad. I like being with my family and I enjoy every bit of the time I spend with them. They are both my strength and weakness. My schooling was very good and I was a very sincere student. After schooling, I did B tech from North Gujarat University and then I completed PGDM in Finance from Alliance Business School, Bangalore. When I am free, I like to swim and read novels. I also like to travel when I get some days off from work.","The man I get married to should be settled in a metropolitan city. This is because I have always lived in big cities and I am very adjustable to the culture people follow there. My lifestyle is according to that and I will only like to settle down in a big city in future. He should be well qualified and educated as I want my partner to have a reasonable outlook towards life. This will not only make him very respectable for me but will also make him a settled human being. If he is settled then we can avoid the tension and pressure that unsettled couples have to face and can spend a peaceful life ahead. He should also be decent looking. I dona??t want him to be a hunk but want him to be pleasant looking. This way we can get fascinated by each other.
He should be very respectful towards elders as this way he can get blessings from them and will be able to get into their good books. I am very emotional and get upset when people hurt my feelings. I hope the man I get married to understands that and takes care of this thing. I am sure he will become my personal favorite if he respects my feelings and emotions.

"Every man on this earth lives a living but only few of them live LIFE. I am one of those people who really live their life. I donAA?A?t think a lot about things and enjoy life as it comes. I donAA?A?t waste even a single second in my life as I think every second is worth a lot of attention and gratitude. I feel life is an experiment, the more experiments one makes the better. I donAA?A?t say I have made many experiments but I support this thought. Life to me is an amazing experience as I am sure that I will not get another chance. As a person, I am very simple and honest. I have never cheated or bluffed any human being as I will not be worthy of my own respect if I do so. I feel that when one is not worthy of his own respect then how can he expect others to respect them. I have never done anything that has let me down. There are things I am not very proud of in myself. I am very innocent and donAA?A?t fight for everything I find wrong. I am a Graphic Designer and enjoy my work a lot. I am not working at the moment as I am searching for a good job. In future, I want to excel in the same field and wish to accomplish myself well. My favorite travel destination is hill stations and they fascinate me a lot. Apart from that, I like reading and listening to music. They not only entertain me but refresh my mind too.","I am very career oriented and enjoy my work a lot. The man I get married to must keep that in my mind and should never ask me to leave my work. This will make me very uncomfortable. I know how to manage work along with household and he wonAA?A?t have to worry about that. I like to be friendly with people who are good me and if the family I get married into is good enough I am sure I will adjust well with them. I will not only respect them but also love them with my whole heart. As I mentioned I am very innocent I donAA?A?t want them to be very clever and take unnecessary advantage of me and my family. They should be as simple as my family and me. This way it will be easy for us to gel up and understand one another well. I am traditional as a person and respect our culture but if required I can adjust to modern ideas and way of living. My adjusting nature has helped me out in every field. The man I get married to must be a professional as this way he will be more responsible as far as our family is concerned. I want him to accept me the way I am, if he is not like that he will not get to see the real me. I am sure that if he is what I want I will make him very happy and all I will require from his side will be support and lots of love and care.
